```python
class Solution:
    def carFleet(self, target: int, position: List[int], speed: List[int]) -> int:
        # sort the cars by their initial positions and estimate their arrival 
        # time
        arrival = [(target - p)/s for p, s in sorted(zip(position, speed))]
        res = 0
        # from the leading car, check the arrival time of the trailing ones to 
        # see how many fleets they can form
        while len(arrival) > 1:
            # get the arrival time of the leading car so far
            cur = arrival.pop()
            # if the arrival time is earlier than its trailing car, they cannot
            # form a fleet but belongs to two fleets. So we increment the number 
            # of fleets by 1
            if cur < arrival[-1]:
                res += 1
            # otherwise, they can form a fleet, so we should check if the next 
            # trailing car can also arrive at the same time with the leader
            else:
                arrival[-1] = cur
        # In case there is only a car left in the lane, it forms a fleet by 
        # itself
        return res + len(arrival)
