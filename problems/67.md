```python
class Solution:
    def addBinary(self, a: str, b: str) -> str:
        # we assume `a` is shorter than `b` in length; if not, swap them so that
        # we save the code for considering both cases. 
        if len(a) > len(b):
            a, b = b, a

        # adding binaries goes from right to left        
        i, j = len(a) - 1, len(b) - 1
        # in the meantime we need to keep track of the carryover if any
        carry = 0
        
        res = ''
        # before reaching the left end of `a`
        while i >= 0:
            # add bits at current positions of both input strings, plus the 
            # carryover if any
            n = int(a[i]) + int(b[j]) + carry
            # grow the result from right to left
            res = str(n%2) + res
            # calculate the carryover
            carry = n//2
            # move left
            i -= 1
            j -= 1
        
        # in case `b` is longer than `a`, before reaching the left end of `b`
        while j >= 0:
            # add the bit and the carryover if any
            n = int(b[j]) + carry
            # grow the result from right to left
            res = str(n%2) + res
            # calculate the carryover
            carry = n//2 
            # move left
            j -= 1
        
        # in case there is carryover left
        if carry > 0:
            # prepend it to the result
            res = str(carry) + res
        
        return res
```

##### String
```python
class Solution:
    """
    This solution resorts to the type convertion provided by the programming 
    language, which should be widely available. The idea is to convert the input 
    strings into integers and add them up, then convert the result integer to 
    binary and then string
    """
    def addBinary(self, a: str, b: str) -> str:
        return bin(int('0b%s'%a, 2) + int('0b%s'%b, 2))[2:]
