1004 Max Consecutive Ones III
=======================
[Problem description](https://leetcode.com/problems/max-consecutive-ones-iii/)

#### Difficulty
<span style="color:#FABC60">Medium</span>

#### Keywords
- [Sliding window](../categories/sliding_window.md)
  
#### Idea
The problem asks us to find the longest consecutive sequence with all ones and allow us to flip at most *K* zeros. We can call the *K* flipping chances as "quota". The idea is to **use sliding window to stretch the right bound until the "quota" runs out, and then closing the left boundary to "replenish" it**. 

#### Complexity
- Runtime: O(N)
- Space: O(1)
  
#### LC performance
- Runtime: 736 ms
- Memory usage: 14.5 MB

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def longestOnes(self, A: List[int], K: int) -> int:
        max_len, l = 0, 0
        for r in range(len(A)):
            if A[r] == 0:
                K -= 1
                while l <= r and K < 0:
                    if A[l] == 0:
                        K += 1
                    l += 1
            if r - l + 1 > max_len:
                max_len = max(max_len, r - l + 1)
        return max_len
