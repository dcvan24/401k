1004 Max Consecutive Ones III
=======================
[Problem description](https://leetcode.com/problems/max-consecutive-ones-iii/)

#### Difficulty
<span style="color:#FABC60">Medium</span>

#### Keywords
- [Sliding window](../categories/sliding_window.md)
  
#### Idea
The problem asks us to find the longest consecutive sequence with all ones and allow us to flip at most *K* zeros. We can call the *K* flipping chances as "quota". The idea is to **use sliding window to stretch the right bound until the "quota" runs out, and then closing the left boundary to "replenish" it**. 

#### Complexity
- Runtime: O(N)
- Space: O(1)
  
#### LC performance
- Runtime: 736 ms
- Memory usage: 14.5 MB

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def longestOnes(self, A: List[int], K: int) -> int:
        maxlen = 0
        l = r = 0
        while r < len(A):
            # fill up zeros seen at the right boundary
            if A[r] == 0:
                K -= 1
            # if the quota is used up, move the left boundary to reclaim flipped
            # zeros in order to replenish the quota
            if K < 0:
                maxlen = max(maxlen, r - l)
                # reclaim flipped zeros and replenish the quota
                if A[l] == 0:
                    K += 1
                l += 1
            r += 1
        return max(maxlen, r - l)
