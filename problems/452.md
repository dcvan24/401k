452 Minimum Number of Arrows to Burst Balloons   
=======================
[Problem description](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-number-of-arrows-to-burst-balloons/)

#### Difficulty
<span style="color:#FABC60">Medium</span>

#### Keywords
- [Greedy](../categories/greedy.md)
  
#### Idea
The problem can be viewed as finding the number of intersections among the given intervals, since it takes the minumum number of arrows to burst all the balloons by shooting at the intersections. The problem is similar to [Merge Intervals](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-intervals/) except that we looks for the number of intersections (where arrows are shot) instead of unions (merged intervals). 

#### Complexity
- Runtime: O(NlogN)
- Space: O(1)
  
#### LC performance
- Runtime: 92 ms
- Memory usage: 16.8 MB

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def findMinArrowShots(self, points: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        if not points:
            return 0
        points.sort()
        
        end, n = None, 0
        for s, e in points:
            if not end or s > end:
                n += 1
                end = e
                continue
            if e < end:
                end = e
        return n
