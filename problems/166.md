#### Idea
The challenge of this problem is how to detect the recurrence, since there can be multiple decimals recurring (e.g., 4/333=0.0120120...). To detect the cycle with multiple vertices, we need to store the trace for the cycle detection, which takes O(N) space. But **how do we uniquely identify each vertex?** Solely the current decimal is insufficient, since it may be resulted from different numerator of the even division, in which case there may not be cycles. For uniqueness, we use the **numerator** and **its corresponding decimal** as the key. In addition, we also store the index of every decimal, so that we know where the recurrence occurs once detecting it, and can denote it in the output. 

The core of the problem is **approximation**, which is the numerical method to perform division between numbers.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def fractionToDecimal(self, numerator: int, denominator: int) -> str:
        if numerator == 0:
            return '0'
        res = []
        if numerator * denominator < 0:
            res += '-',
        remain, div = abs(numerator), abs(denominator)
        if remain >= div:
            res += str(remain//div),
            remain %= div
            if remain > 0:
                res += '.',
        else:
            res += '0.',
        trace, idx = {}, -1
        
        while remain != 0:
            remain *= 10
            val = remain//div
            idx = trace.get((remain, val), -1)
            if idx != -1:
                break
            trace[(remain, val)] = len(res)
            res += str(val),
            remain %= div
        
        if idx != -1:
            res.insert(idx, '(')
            res += ')',
        
        return ''.join(res)
