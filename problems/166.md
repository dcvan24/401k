#### Idea
The challenge of this problem is how to detect the recurrence, since there can be multiple decimals recurring (e.g., 4/333=0.0120120...). To detect the cycle with multiple vertices, we need to store the trace for the cycle detection, which takes O(N) space. But **how do we uniquely identify each vertex?** Solely the current decimal is insufficient, since it may be resulted from different numerator of the even division, in which case there may not be cycles. For uniqueness, we use the **numerator** and **its corresponding decimal** as the key. In addition, we also store the index of every decimal, so that we know where the recurrence occurs once detecting it, and can denote it in the output. 

The core of the problem is **approximation**, which is the numerical method to perform division between numbers.

    def fractionToDecimal(self, numerator: int, denominator: int) -> str:

        # the result is zero if the numerator is zero
        if num == 0:
            return '0'
        res = ''
        # start the result with negative sign if the signs of the numerator and 
        # denominator are not same
        if num * dem < 0:
            res += '-'
        
        # take the absolute values of both the numerator and denominator after 
        # the sign is determined
        num, dem = abs(num), abs(dem)
        # find out the quotient for the integer part
        if num < dem:
            res += '0.'
        else:
            q, num = divmod(num, dem)
            res += str(q)
            # append the dot if the numerator cannot be evenly divided
            if num > 0:
                res += '.'

        # consider the decimal only if the numerator cannot be divided evenly
        if not num:

        # uniquely identified by the quotient and remainder of division

            num *= 10
            q, num = divmod(num, dem)
            idx = seen.get((q, num), -1)
            # if the quotient and remainder are seen before
            if idx != -1:
                # wrap the repeating part with parentheses and break the loop
                res = res[:idx] + '(%s)'%res[idx:]
                break
            # add the position of the quotient in the result
            seen[(q, num)] = len(res)
            # append the quotient to the result
