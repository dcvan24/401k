202 Happy Number
=======================
[Problem description](https://leetcode.com/problems/happy-number/)

#### Difficulty
<span style="color:green">Easy</span>

#### Keywords
- Floyd cycle detection (fast-slow pointers)

#### Idea
It is easy to use a traceback stack to find the cycle, but [this solution](https://leetcode.com/problems/happy-number/discuss/56917/My-solution-in-C(-O(1)-space-and-no-magic-math-property-involved-)) is more interesting.

#### Complexity
- Runtime: N/A
- Space: O(1) 

#### LC performance
- Runtime: 40 ms
- Memory usage: 13.2 MB

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def isHappy(self, n: int) -> bool:
        
        def newNum(num):
            res = 0
            while num > 0:
                res += (num%10) ** 2
                num //= 10
            return res
        
        slow = fast = n
        
        while True:
            slow, fast = newNum(slow), newNum(fast)
            fast = newNum(fast)
            if slow == fast:
                break
                
        return slow == 1
