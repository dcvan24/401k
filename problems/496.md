496 Next Greater Element I
=======================
[Problem description](https://leetcode.com/problems/next-greater-element-i/)

#### Difficulty
<span style="color:green">Easy</span>

#### Keywords
- [Monotonic stack](../categories/monotonic_stack.md)

#### Idea
The key is to maintain a **monotonic decreasing stack** for `nums2` to find the next greater element. Specifically, if a number in `nums2` violates the monotonicity and appears in `nums1`, its next greater element will be the new number just placed into the stack. For instance, say `nums2 = [1, 2, 3]`, `1` will be placed into the stack initially followed by 2; however, `2` is greater than `1` and thus breaks the decreasing monotonicity. So `1` will be popped off from the stack, and `2` is identified as the next greater element of `1` if `1` appears in `nums1`. 

#### Complexity

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def nextGreaterElement(self, nums1: List[int], nums2: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        res, stack = [-1] * len(nums1), []
        indices = {n: i for i, n in enumerate(nums1)}
        for n in nums2:
            while stack and stack[-1] < n:
                idx = indices.get(stack.pop(), -1)
                if idx != -1:
                    res[idx] = n
            stack += n,
        return res
