543 Diameter of Binary Tree
=======================
[Problem description](https://leetcode.com/problems/diameter-of-binary-tree/)

#### Difficulty
<span style="color:green">Easy</span>

#### Keywords
- [Tree post-order traversal](../categories/tree_postorder.md)

#### Idea
The definition of the diameter of binary tree is **the length of the longest path between any two nodes in a tree**, therefore path may or may not pass through the root and we need to explore every possible path in the tree. Obviously, for any node in the tree, the longest possible path is from the deepest node on the left to the deepest on the other side through the current node. In effect, the length of the longest path is sum of the depth of left and right subtrees plus one (the pass-through node). As a result, we get the number of nodes on the longest path in the tree, and the diameter counts the edges between the nodes, which is the number of nodes minus 1. 

#### Complexity
- Runtime: O(N)
- Space: O(1)
  
#### LC performance
- Runtime: 36 ms
- Memory usage: 15 MB

#### Code
```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.left = None
#         self.right = None

class Solution:
    def diameterOfBinaryTree(self, root: TreeNode) -> int:
        if not root:
            return 0
        n_nodes = 0
        
        def postorder(n):
            if not n:
                return 0
            l, r = postorder(n.left), postorder(n.right)
            nonlocal n_nodes
            n_nodes = max(n_nodes, l + r + 1)
            return max(l, r) + 1
        
        postorder(root)
        
        return n_nodes - 1
