#### Idea
The definition of the diameter of binary tree is **the length of the longest path between any two nodes in a tree**, therefore path may or may not pass through the root and we need to explore every possible path in the tree. Obviously, for any node in the tree, the longest possible path is from the deepest node on the left to the deepest on the other side through the current node. In effect, the length of the longest path is sum of the depth of left and right subtrees plus one (the pass-through node). As a result, we get the number of nodes on the longest path in the tree, and the diameter counts the edges between the nodes, which is the number of nodes minus 1. 

#### Complexity
- Runtime: O(N)
- Space: O(1)
  
#### LC performance
- Runtime: 52 ms
- Memory usage: 16.3 MB

#### Code
```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.left = None
#         self.right = None

class Solution:
    def diameterOfBinaryTree(self, root: TreeNode) -> int:
        if not root:
            return 0
        
        # the maximum number of nodes is initialized as 1, which is the root 
        # by itself
        max_nodes = 1

        # by definition, the diameter is the longest path between any two nodes
        # in the tree, which may or may not pass through the root. Obviously, 
        # the longest path not passing through the root is from the root to the 
        # deepest leaf, which is equivalent to finding the depth of the tree. So
        # we probe the depth of the left and right subtree, and update the max 
        # number of nodes during the process
        def depth(n):
            if not n:
                return 0
            # depth of left and right subtrees
            l, r = depth(n.left), depth(n.right)
            nonlocal max_nodes
            # the path passing through the root
            max_nodes = max(max_nodes, l + r + 1)
            # return the longer path to the next recursion
            return max(l, r) + 1
        
        depth(root)
        
        # since the diameter counts the edges, so it is the number of edges 
        # minus one. 
        return max_nodes - 1
