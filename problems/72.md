78 Subsets
=======================
[Problem description](https://leetcode.com/problems/subsets/)

#### Difficulty
<span style="color:#FABC60">Medium</span>

#### Keywords
- Breadth-first search
  
#### Idea
The key is to notice that the graph is **undirected**, i.e., subset `[1, 2]` is equivalent to `[2, 1]`. Hence, when traversing the array during BFS, the algorithm only look forward rather than backward in order to add new number into the subset. 

#### Complexity
- Runtime: O($N^2$)
- Space: O(1)
  
#### LC performance
- Runtime: 40 ms
- Memory usage: 13.4 MB

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def subsets(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[List[int]]:
        from collections import deque
        
        res, q = [], deque([([], 0)])
        while q:
            ss, offset = q.popleft()
            res += ss,
            for i, n in enumerate(nums[offset:]):
                q += (ss + [n], offset + i + 1),
        
        return res
```
