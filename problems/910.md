#### Keywords
- Array
  
#### Idea
To minimize the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the altered array, intuitively we need to **increment the smaller values and decrement the larger ones**. Obviously, we can compare values and find the maximum/minimum values more easily in a sorted array, therefore we need to sort the given array first. With the array sorted, the first and last values are the minimum and maximum values, respectively, and any value at *i* is smaller than that at *i + 1*. As the intuition suggests, we will add *K* to the value at *i* but subtract *K* from that at *i + 1* in order to minimize the difference, since apparently doing the opposite will increase the difference by 2 * *K*. In the meantime, the addition/subtraction will may also change the maximum/minimum values of the array if *K* is dominantly larger than the values in the array. Hence, we need to compare the values after addition/subtraction to the maximum/minimum values to see if they are replaced by values after the alteration. We scan the array linearly and performs the process described above to find the minimum difference.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def smallestRangeII(self, A: List[int], K: int) -> int:
        A.sort()
        min_v, max_v = A[0], A[-1]
        res = max_v - min_v
        for i in range(len(A) - 1):
            res = min(res, max(max_v - K, A[i] + K) - min(min_v + K, A[i + 1] - K))
        return res
