#### Keywords

#### Idea
The basic idea is to traverse the binary tree recursively, and find the maximum path sum. There are two challenges: 1) a path can span across the left and right subtrees via the parent node; 2) there can be nodes with negative numbers in the tree. 

To address Challenge 1), we need to keep track of two sums, i.e., the **global and local maximum path sums**. The global path sum is what we are looking for; the local maximum path sum is the maximum path sum of the left and right sub-paths. The major difference is that the global maximum path sum can include **both** sub-paths as part of the path, while the local one must choose **either** sub-path to consist the larger path in the upper level. For each recursion, we use the local maximum path sums to calculate all the possible path sums, and compare-and-replace the global maximum path sum. 

To address Challenge 2), we need to ignore sub-paths with a negative sum, since these sub-paths will not contribute to maximizing the path sum. Ignoring the sub-paths can be easily implemented by "clipping" the path sum by zero - any sub-paths with a negative sum return zero as the local maximum path sum. 

#### Complexity

#### Code

```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.left = None
#         self.right = None

class Solution:
    def maxPathSum(self, root: TreeNode) -> int:
        
        def recurse(n):
            if not n:
                return None, 0
            l_max, l_sum = recurse(n.left)
            r_max, r_sum = recurse(n.right) 
            max_sum = n.val + l_sum + r_sum
            if l_max is not None:
                max_sum = max(max_sum, l_max)
            if r_max is not None:
                max_sum = max(max_sum, r_max)
            path_sum = max(l_sum, r_sum) + n.val
            
            return max_sum, max(path_sum, 0)
        
        return recurse(root)[0]
