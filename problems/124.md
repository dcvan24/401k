#### Idea
The basic idea is to traverse the binary tree recursively, and find the maximum path sum. There are two challenges: 1) a path can span across the left and right subtrees via the parent node; 2) there can be nodes with negative numbers in the tree. 

To address Challenge 1), we need to keep track of two sums, i.e., the **global and local maximum path sums**. The global path sum is what we are looking for; the local maximum path sum is the maximum path sum of the left and right sub-paths. The major difference is that the global maximum path sum can include **both** sub-paths as part of the path, while the local one must choose **either** sub-path to consist the larger path in the upper level. For each recursion, we use the local maximum path sums to calculate all the possible path sums, and compare-and-replace the global maximum path sum. 

To address Challenge 2), we need to ignore sub-paths with a negative sum, since these sub-paths will not contribute to maximizing the path sum. Ignoring the sub-paths can be easily implemented by "clipping" the path sum by zero - any sub-paths with a negative sum return zero as the local maximum path sum.

#### Code

```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.left = None
#         self.right = None

class Solution:
    def maxPathSum(self, root: TreeNode) -> int:
        # initialize the max sum as negative infinite since there may be 
        # negative values in the tree
        maxsum = float('-inf')

        def postorder(n):
            if not n:
                return 0
            nonlocal maxsum
            # the max sum of the left subtree. Note that the sum is picked up 
            # only if it is greater than 0; otherwise it doesn't contribute to 
            # the increase of the max sum and should be thus ignored.
            l = max(postorder(n.left), 0)
            # the max sum of the right subtree
            r = max(postorder(n.right), 0)
            # the max sum of the path through the current node
            maxsum = max(maxsum, l + r + n.val)
            # pick up the larger sum of the subtrees, or possibily neither (if 
            # sums of the both subtrees are less than 0), plus the current 
            # node's value for the next recursion.
            return max(l, r) + n.val
        
        postorder(root)

        return maxsum
