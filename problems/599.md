599 Minimum Index Sum of Two Lists    
=======================
[Problem description](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-index-sum-of-two-lists/)

#### Difficulty
<span style="color:green">Easy</span>

#### Keywords
- Hash Table

#### Idea
The solution is obvious. Note that we need to rule out the options uncommon to both even they are the at the top on either's list, and we are asked to return all the minimum ties. 

#### Complexity
- Runtime: O(N)
- Space: O(N)

#### LC performance
- Runtime: 68 ms
- Memory usage: 13.7 MB

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def findRestaurant(self, list1: List[str], list2: List[str]) -> List[str]:
        v1 = {n: i for i, n in enumerate(list1)}
        v2 = {n: i for i, n in enumerate(list2)}
        max_v = len(v1) + len(v2)
        for k, v in v2.items():
            v1[k] = v1.setdefault(k, max_v) + v
        for k in v1:
            if k not in v2:
                v1[k] += max_v
        min_v = min(v1.values())
        if min_v >= max_v:
            return []
        return [k for k, v in v1.items() if v == min_v]
