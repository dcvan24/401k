class Solution:
    def merge(self, intervals: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
        res = []
        # sort the intervals by the starting time
        intervals.sort()
        for i in intervals:
            s, e = i
            # if the starting time of the current interval is greater than the 
            # last merged interval, it means these intervals are disjoint and 
            # thus current interval is apppended to the result
            if not res or s > res[-1][1]:
                res.append(i)
            # otherwise, the current interval and the last merge one intersect 
            # with each other, so we need to update the last merged interval. 
            # Since the intervals are sorted by the starting time, the current 
            # starting time is definitely larger than the last merged one, but 
            # the current ending time can be larger. So we only update the 
            # ending time of the last merged interval by taking the larger one
            else:
                res[-1][1] = max(res[-1][1], e)
        return res
