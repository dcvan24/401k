```python
class Solution:
    def canConvert(self, str1: str, str2: str) -> bool:
        # if it requires no conversion, return true
        if str1 == str2:
            return True
        # the key of the conversion is that there must be at least one letter 
        # not appearing in `str2`, which serves as the intermediate for the 
        # conversion, otherwise any conversion will lead to collisions and thus 
        # fails. 
        # 
        # apprently, the length of the two strings must match
        if len(set(str2)) == 26 or len(str1) != len(str2):
            return False
        # the whole idea is to find mappings of letters between the given 
        # strings and check if there is any conflict. For example, if letter `a` 
        # in `str1` has already been mapped to letter `b` in `str2`, mapping `a` 
        # in `str1` again to `c` in `str2` results a conflict, which indicates 
        # that the conversion is impossible, since one character is required to 
        # map to two characters simultaneously, which is impossible. 
        m = {}
        for c1, c2 in zip(str1, str2):
            if m.setdefault(c1, c2) != c2:
                return False
        return True
