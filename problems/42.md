42 Trapping Rain Water    
=======================
[Problem description](https://leetcode.com/problems/trapping-rain-water/)

#### Difficulty
<span style="color:red">Hard</span>

#### Keywords
- Monotonic decreasing stack
  
#### Idea
The key is essentially using a **monotonic decreasing stack** to keep track of the elevations in a descending order. If the order is violated, it means there is a **pit** between the top of the stack and the current elevation, where the rain can be trapped. So we need to add the trapped rain to the total. The size of the water body depends on the **width**, **bottom** and **bounds**. The width and bounds are straightforward - the width is the distance between the two bounds; we take the shorter one from the two bounds. The bottom is the elevation in between - to calculate the size, we need to further *subtract the height of the bottom from the shorter bound* as the **actual height** of the water. So on we can get the total amount of rain being trapped.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def trap(self, height: List[int]) -> int:
        stack = []
        water = 0 
        for r, rh in enumerate(height):
            while stack and height[stack[-1]] < rh:
                pit = stack.pop()
                if not stack:
                    break
                l = stack[-1]
                water += (r - l - 1) * (min(rh, height[l]) - height[pit])
            stack += r,
        return water
