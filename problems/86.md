#### Idea
This problem is very straightfoward, but the challenge lies in the details. We are asked to partition the list by a given value, so intuitively we need to keep two lists for the different partitions, and concatenate them at the end. Specifically, we can traverse the given list and take out the lessers to another separate list for them. In the end, the given list will only contain the greaters. Then we can concatenate the lesser list and the original one, and return the head of the lesser list as the head of the partitioned list. 

To remove lessors from the original list, we keep track of the precursor - if the current node is a lesser, we let the precursor skip the current node to the next one for node removal. To deal with the nodes at the ends, we introduce dummy nodes as heads of the partition list to simplify the solution.

#### Code
```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.next = None

class Solution:
    def partition(self, head: ListNode, x: int) -> ListNode:
        l = lesser = ListNode(-1)
        pre = ListNode(-1)
        pre.next = cur = head
        head = pre
        
        while cur:
            if cur.val < x:
                pre.next = cur.next
                l.next = cur
                l = l.next
                cur = cur.next
                l.next = None
            else:
                cur = cur.next
                pre = pre.next

        l.next = head.next
        
        return lesser.next
```
