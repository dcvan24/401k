287 Find the Duplicate Number  
=======================
[Problem description](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-duplicate-number/)

#### Difficulty
<span style="color:#FABC60">Medium</span>

#### Keywords
- [Floyd cycle detection](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-does-floyds-slow-and-fast-pointers-approach-work/)

#### Idea
The problem is equivalent to [#142](142.md) given an array of `n + 1` in length that contains **numbers from 1 to n** and **must exist a duplicate number**. We can interpret the given constraints as that **every number has a dedicate index but the duplicate one appears at two indices**. So if we use the value at a position as the new position to traverse the array, we can traverse it infinitely until we find the duplicate. Hence, the traversal is just like moving pointers in a linked list with a cycle - **if there is a number appears twice in the array, the traversal will enter a loop between the duplicates back and forth**, and it is just like what we face in #142. As a solution, we can use **Floyd cycle detection** to find where the cycle starts. 

#### Complexity
- Runtime: O(N)
- Space: O(1)
  
#### LC performance

- Memory usage: 16.3 MB

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def findDuplicate(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        slow = fast = 0
        while True:
            slow = nums[slow]
            fast = nums[nums[fast]]
            if nums[slow] == nums[fast]:
                slow = 0
                while nums[slow] != nums[fast]:
                    slow = nums[slow]
                    fast = nums[fast]
                return nums[slow]
```
