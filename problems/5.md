##### DP
The key is to save the **duplicate steps for validating palindromes**. The approach is to memoize the validation results for every substring and reuse them for validating the longer substrings. 

There is room for improving the runtime and space. To improve the runtime, it may be conducive to replacing the recursion with an iterative approach in order to save the overhead for function calls. Besides, current traversal pattern cannot fully utilize the memoization. New traversal approach may improve the runtime. 

Time complexity: O($N^2$)
Space complexity: O($N^2$)

```python
class Solution:
    def longestPalindrome(self, s: str) -> str:
        
        def is_palindrome(i, j, memo):
            if i >= j:
                return True
            ends = (i, j)
            if ends in memo:
                return memo[ends]
            memo[ends] = s[i] == s[j] and is_palindrome(i + 1, j - 1, memo)
            return memo[ends]
        
        memo, start, end = {}, 0, 0
        for i in range(len(s)):
            for j in range(len(s) - 1, i - 1, -1):
                slen, cur_len = j - i + 1, end - start + 1
                if slen < cur_len or not is_palindrome(i, j, memo):
                    continue
                if slen > cur_len:
                    start, end = i, j
        return s[start: end + 1]
```

##### Two pointers
The idea is to treat every position in the given string as the center of a 
palindrome, and grow it towards both directions if possible. During growing the 
palindromes, we compare the size of the found palindromes and eventually find 
the longest one. 

Time complexity: O($N^2$)
Space complexity: O(1)

```python
class Solution:
    def longestPalindrome(self, s: str) -> str:
        maxlen = 0
        res = ''
        for c in range(2*len(s) - 1):
            l = c//2
            r = l + c%2
            while l >= 0 and r < len(s) and s[l] == s[r]:
                if r - l + 1 > maxlen:
                    maxlen = r - l + 1
                    res = s[l: r + 1]
                l -= 1
                r += 1
        return res
```
