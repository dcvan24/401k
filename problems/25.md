#### Idea
The problem is equivalent to repeating [reversal of sub-lists in a given range](92.md) for k times. Recall the auxiliary variables for reversing a sub-list in a given range, we need to memorize the leading and trailing nodes of the sub-list, so that the reversed sub-list can be put back at the right position. Meanwhile, we need to substitute the head of the list with the last node in the first group. In conclusion, we need variables `lead`, `pre` and `post` in addition to the head and tail of every sub-list to be reversed. 

The rest of the algorithm is simply repetition of the reversal. Note that the last few nodes may not form a group since their length is less than *k*. In this case, the algorithm should stop immediately instead of reversing the remainders as a partial group.

#### Code
```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.next = None

class Solution:
    def reverseKGroup(self, head: ListNode, k: int) -> ListNode:
        """
        The idea is simple - find every k-group sublist and reverse it. Two keys 
        to solve the problem:
        - use two variables to mark the leader and trailer of every k-group 
          sublist, which are useful for putting back the reversed sublist 
          properly.
        - know how to reverse a linked list
