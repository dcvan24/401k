- Space: O(1)
  
#### LC performance
- Runtime: 40 ms
- Memory usage: 13.9 MB

#### Code
##### Straightforward 
```python
class Solution:
    def isPowerOfFour(self, num: int) -> bool:
        if num == 0:
            return False
        while num%4 == 0:
            num /= 4
        return num == 1
```

##### Bitwise
```python
class Solution:
    def isPowerOfFour(self, num: int) -> bool:
        # 1. check if the number is greater than zero 
        # 2. check if the number is even
        # 3. check if the number has nothing in common with the odd with only 
        #    the even bit set, i.e., 0xaaaaaaaa, but the number that is a power 
        #    of four has only the odd bit set. 
        return num > 0 and num&(num - 1) == 0 and num&0xaaaaaaaa == 0
```
