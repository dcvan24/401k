- Merge sort

#### Idea
Merge sort is more efficient than other sorting algorithms, e.g., quick sort, because of its stability and efficiency in space when sorting a linked list, as indicated in [this post](https://www.tutorialcup.com/linked-list/merge-sort-better-quick-sort-linked-lists.htm). 

A bit background on merge sort and quick sort - merge sort is a stable sorting algorithm, giving a stable O(NlogN) runtime and paying O(N) auxiliary space for the merge operation for arrays; quick sort is a fast *in-place* sorting algorithm, giving O(NlogN) runtime in average but quadratic in worst case with bad pivoting. In a nutshell, quick sort is a better fit for sorting arrays, since it is an in-place algorithm that does not need auxiliary space, i.e., O(1) space complexity. More importantly, since elements in arrays are stored in adjacent memory frames, the in-place sorting results better data locality and thus achieves better runtime. In contrast, merge sort is a better fit for linked lists, since elements are linked by pointers and merging sub-lists will not need auxiliary space as it requires for arrays. Dividing and merging sub-lists are very straightforward in merge sort, and we also benefit from its stability. However, since elements in a linked list are scattered in memory, quick sort cannot gain any data locality as it does for arrays, and does not win any advantage for its in-place sorting behavior. On the contrary, it takes additional steps to pivot and partition the sub-lists. Moreover, we also run the risk of running the quadratic runtime due to bad pivoting.

#### Code
```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.next = None

class Solution:
    def sortList(self, head: ListNode) -> ListNode:
        
        def merge(l, r):
            p = h = None
            while l and r:
                n = None
                if l.val < r.val:
                    n = l
                    l = l.next
                else:
                    n = r
                    r = r.next
                if h:
                    p.next =n
                    p = p.next
                else:
                    p = h = n
            while l:
                if h:
                    p.next = l
                    p = p.next
                else:
                    p = h = l
                l = l.next
            while r:
                if h:
                    p.next = r
                    p = p.next
                else:
                    p = h = r
                r = r.next
            return h
                
        
        def mergesort(n, l):
            if l < 2:
                return n
            pre, cur = n, n.next
            for _ in range(l//2 - 1):
                pre = pre.next
                cur = cur.next
            pre.next = None
            return merge(mergesort(n, l//2), mergesort(cur, l - l//2))
        
        l, p = 0, head
        while p:
            l += 1
            p = p.next
        return mergesort(head, l)
