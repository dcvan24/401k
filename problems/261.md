#### Idea
By definition, a tree has only a single root and there must not be any cycles. 
So our goal is to verify if there is only a single root for all the unioned 
nodes, and if there is any cycle. 

To verify the first condition, we count the number of roots in the graph during 
the union-find process. Initially, all the nodes have themselves as their root, 
and there are `n` roots in the graph. When two nodes are unioned, the root of 
one node becomes the root of the other, and the number of roots in the graph 
decrements by 1. Eventually, if the given graph is valid tree, there should exist 
only one root. 

To verify the second condition, we check if two nodes have the same root when 
being unioned. If they do, that means they converge at the root via certain paths. 
In the meantime, since there is an edge between the nodes to be unioned, there is 
a cycle among the two nodes and their root. In summary, if we find two nodes have 
the same root, it indicates the existence of a cycle and the given graph is thus 
not a valid tree.

#### Code
##### DFS
```python
class Solution:
    def validTree(self, n: int, edges: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
        visited = set()
        g = {}
        
        for u, v in edges:
            g.setdefault(u, []).append(v)
            g.setdefault(v, []).append(u)
            
        def find_cycle(u, parent):
            visited.add(u)
            for v in g.get(u, []):
                if v not in visited:
                    if find_cycle(v, u):
                        return True
                elif v != parent:
                    return True
            return False
        
        if find_cycle(0, -1):
            return False
        return len(visited) == n
```

##### Union-find
```python
class Solution:
    def validTree(self, n: int, edges: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
        parents = list(range(n))
        
        def find(x):
            if x != parents[x]:
                parents[x] = find(parents[x])
            return parents[x]
        
        def union(u, v):
            nonlocal n
            pu, pv = find(u), find(v)
            if pu == pv:
                return False
            parents[pu] = pv
            n -= 1
            return True
        
        for u, v in edges:
            if not union(u, v):
                return False
        
        return n == 1
