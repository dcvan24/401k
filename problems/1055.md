class Solution:
    def shortestWay(self, source: str, target: str) -> int:
        # `left` keeps track of the current position we are at in `source`, 
        # initialized as the beginning of `source`
        # `mini` is the minimum number of substrings of `source` needed, which 
        # is at least 1 if the transition is possible
        left, mini = 0, 1
        for c in target:
            # find the current letter in `target` from `source` between our 
            # current position in `source` and the end of it
            left = source.find(c, left)
            # if the letter is not found
            if left == -1:
                # it may appear before our current position, so we reset our
                # current position to the beginning of `source` and search it 
                # again
                left = source.find(c, 0)
                # if still not found, the letter does not appear anywhere in 
                # `source`, so the transition is impossible and thus return -1
                if left == -1:
                    return -1
                # otherwise, the letter does appear in front of the previous 
                # position in `source`. By resetting our position in `source`, 
                # we add an extra substring needed for the transition
                mini += 1
            # our position in `source` moves forward to the right at every step
            left += 1
        return mini
