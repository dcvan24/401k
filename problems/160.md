160 Intersection of Two Linked Lists
=======================
[Problem description](https://leetcode.com/problems/intersection-of-two-linked-lists/)

#### Difficulty
<span style="color:green">Easy</span>

#### Keywords
- Linked list

#### Idea
The crux is to recognize that **the shared sub-list has only one length**, i.e., the two input lists must have the same length if they intersect with each other at the first node. Therefore, we need to align the input lists first before start looking for the intersection. Since the input lists share the same sub-list after the intersection, they should be aligned to the right. Therefore we need to move forward the head of the longer list in order to make them equal in length. After the alignment, we start traversing the two lists simultaneously to find if there is any node sharing the same **reference (not value)** and return it if any.

            while p:
                l += 1
                p = p.next
            return l
        
        len_a, len_b = get_length(headA), get_length(headB)
        
        while headA and len_a > len_b:
            headA = headA.next
            len_a -= 1
        
        while headB and len_b > len_a:
            headB = headB.next
            len_b -= 1
        
        if len_a != len_b:
            return None
        
        pa, pb = headA, headB
        for _ in range(len_a):
            if pa == pb:
                return pa
