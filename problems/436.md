436 Find Right Interval
=======================
[Problem description](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-right-interval/)

#### Difficulty
<span style="color:#FABC60">Medium</span>

#### Keywords
- Hash indexing
- Sorting
- Binary search

#### Idea
We are asked to find **index** of the **minimum** right starting point for each interval in the given list. Hence, we need to **keep the starting points in order**, so that we are able to find the closest starting point on the right for any given ending point of an interval in O(logN) time using **binary search**. Meanwhile, to locate the minimum interval in the given list, we need to keep track of the indices of every interval in the original list. Preferably, we use a **hash table** to track the indices in $\Theta$(1) time. 

#### Complexity
- Runtime: O(NlogN)
- Space: O(N)

#### LC performance
- Runtime: 124 ms
- Memory usage: 17.1 MB

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def findRightInterval(self, intervals: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
        indices = {s: i for i, (s, _) in enumerate(intervals)}
        starts = sorted(indices.keys())
        res = []
        
        import bisect as bi
        for _, e in intervals:
            p = bi.bisect_left(starts, e)
            if p == len(intervals):
                res += -1,
                continue
            res += indices[starts[p]],
        
        return res
```
