class Solution:
    def prevPermOpt1(self, A: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        # find the number at `l` that makes A[l:] not non-decreasing
        l = len(A) - 2
        while l >= 0:
            if A[l] > A[l + 1]:
                break
            l -= 1
        # if the given array is non-decreasing, it is the smallest permutation 
        # on its own, so return itself
        else:
            return A
        
        # otherwise, `l` is the left number to be swapped and the other is on 
        # its right.
        # 
        # Since we look for the largest permutation smaller than the given one, 
        # the result permutation should not be too small but just smaller than 
        # the given one lexicographically. Since A[l] leads the permutation of 
        # A[l:], we should replace A[l] with a smaller number to make A[l:] 
        # smaller. In the meantime, the replacement number must be the largest 
        # one in A[l + 1:] to make A[l:] the smaller permutation next to the 
        # given A[l:]
        r = l + 1
        for i in range(l + 1, len(A)):
            if A[r] < A[i] < A[l]:
                r = i
        A[l], A[r] = A[r], A[l]
        return A
