322 Coin Change
=======================
[Problem description](https://leetcode.com/problems/coin-change/)

#### Difficulty
<span style="color:#FABC60">Medium</span>

#### Keywords
- [Dynamic programming](../categories/dp.md)

#### Idea
The idea is similar to [#279](279.md) except that the solution space is continuous in #279 but discrete here - every number can be at least decomposed to a number of 1s in #279, but not every amount can be decomposed to a combination of coins from the given coin set. Hence, for certain given amount, the solution may not exist. 

Hence, the modification in addition to #279 is to **check if the solution to the remainder exists** if using a coin with a specific denomination - if not, we should skip using this coin for the current amount.

#### Complexity
- Runtime: O(MN)
- Space: O(N)

#### LC performance
- Runtime: 1716 ms
- Memory usage: 14 MB

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def coinChange(self, coins: List[int], amount: int) -> int:
        dp = [-1] * (amount + 1)
        dp[0] = 0
        
        for i in range(1, amount + 1):
            for v in coins:
                if v > i:
                    continue
                if v == i:
                    dp[i] = 1
                elif dp[i - v] > 0:
                    val = dp[v] + dp[i - v]
                    dp[i] = val if dp[i] == -1 else min(dp[i], val)
        
        return dp[-1]
