class Solution:
    def canJump(self, nums: List[int]) -> bool:
        max_reach = 0
        for i, n in enumerate(nums):
            if i == 0 and n == 0 and len(nums) > 1:
                return False
            max_reach = max(max_reach, i + n + 1)
            if max_reach >= len(nums):
                return True
            if max_reach == i + 1 and n == 0:
                return False
        return max_reach >= len(nums)
