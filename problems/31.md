        Two key observations in the problem:
            1. A decreasing array is the last permutation of the array, and the 
               next one is the reverse of it. For example, `3,2,1` is the last 
               permutation of this array and `1,2,3` will be next.
            2. For a decreasing subarray, there is a number right before the 
               subarray that "leads" the subarray, e.g., `2,4,3,1` in which `2` 
               "leads" the subarray `4,3,1`. Similarly, the decreasing subarray 
               is the last permutation of itself, and the next one should be 
               mostly the reverse of the subarray, except that the "leading" 
               number is going to change. Looking at the previous example, the 
               next permutation is `3,1,2,4` wherein the "leading" number is 
               `3`, which is the next greater number than `2` in the sequence. 
               Herein, the rule for generating the next permutation for a 
               subarray is - 1) swap the "leading" number and the next greater 
               one in the decreasing subarray; 2) reverse the decreasing 
               subarray.
        In summary, the whole process should be the following:
            1. Find the decreasing subarray if not the entire array
            2. If it is not the entire array, swap the "leading" number and its 
               next greater number in the decreasing subarray
            3. Reverse the decreasing part
        """
        # if there is only a single number in the array, the next permutation is
        # itself
        if len(nums) == 1:
            return 

        # find the decreasing subarray from right to left and the pointer stops 
        # at the "leading" number, if not the head of the array
        end = len(nums) - 1
        start = end - 1
        while start >= 0:
            if nums[start] < nums[start + 1]:
                break
            start -= 1

        # find the two ends of the subarray to be reversed
        if start < 0:
            # if the entire array is decreasing, the entire array needs to be 
            # reversed end-to-end
            start = 0
        else:
            # otherwise, we have a decreasing subarray and a "leading" number, 
            # so we find and swap the "leading" number and its next greater 
            # first

            nums[start], nums[i] = nums[i], nums[start]
            
            # the decreasing subarray will be reversed
            start += 1

        # reverse the decreasing subarray in-place
        while start < end:
            nums[start], nums[end] = nums[end], nums[start]
