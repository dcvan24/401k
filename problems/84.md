#### Idea
The trick is to use a stack to keep track of the **minimum heights** in order and traverse the histogram to find the largest rectangle. During the traversal, we look for the largest rectangle **dominated by the height**, meaning the area of the rectangle is determined by its height. For instance, bar 0 is the locally largest height in [0, 1], so the largest rectangle so far is `2 * 1 = 2`; bar 3 is another local maxima in [1, 3], and the largest rectangle is `5 * 2 = 10`. 

After the traversal, we also look for any possible largest rectangle **dominated by its horizontal span**, meaning the area of the rectangle is determined by its horizontal span. For instance, we can find a rectangle with the height of 1 but span of 6 in the given example, which could potentially be the largest rectangle in certain examples. 

The solution only traverses the height array once and requires a stack to keep track of the minimum heights, therefore both the time and space complexity are O(N).    

#### Complexity
- Runtime: O(N)
- Space: O(N)
  
#### LC performance
- Runtime: 80 ms
- Memory usage: 15 MB

#### Code

```python
class Solution:
    def largestRectangleArea(self, heights: List[int]) -> int:
        max_area = 0
        stack = [-1]
        
        for i, h in enumerate(heights):
            while stack[-1] != -1 and heights[stack[-1]] > h:
                max_area = max(max_area, heights[stack.pop()] * (i - stack[-1] - 1))
            stack.append(i)
        while stack[-1] != -1:
            max_area = max(max_area, heights[stack.pop()] * (len(heights) - stack[-1] - 1))
        return max_area
```

```python
import bisect as bi

class Solution:
    def lengthOfLIS(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        steps = []
        for n in nums:
            idx = bi.bisect_left(steps, n)
            if idx == len(steps):
                steps.append(n)
            elif n != steps[idx]:
                steps[idx] = n

        return len(steps)
