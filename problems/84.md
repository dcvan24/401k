84 Largest Rectangle in Histogram
=======================

#### Difficulty

#### Keywords
- Monotonic increasing stack

  
#### Idea
The trick is to use a stack to keep track of the **minimum heights** in order and traverse the histogram to find the largest rectangle. During the traversal, we look for the largest rectangle **dominated by the height**, meaning the area of the rectangle is determined by its height. For instance, bar 0 is the locally largest height in [0, 1], so the largest rectangle so far is `2 * 1 = 2`; bar 3 is another local maxima in [1, 3], and the largest rectangle is `5 * 2 = 10`. 

After the traversal, we also look for any possible largest rectangle **dominated by its horizontal span**, meaning the area of the rectangle is determined by its horizontal span. For instance, we can find a rectangle with the height of 1 but span of 6 in the given example, which could potentially be the largest rectangle in certain examples. 

The solution only traverses the height array once and requires a stack to keep track of the minimum heights, therefore both the time and space complexity are O(N).    

#### Complexity
- Runtime: O(N)
- Space: O(N)
  
#### LC performance
- Runtime: 80 ms
- Memory usage: 15 MB

#### Code

```python
class Solution:
    def largestRectangleArea(self, heights: List[int]) -> int:
        largest = 0
        stack = []
        
        for i, h in enumerate(heights):
            l = i
            while stack and h < stack[-1][1]:
                l, w = stack.pop()
                largest = max(largest, w * (i - l))
            stack += (l, h),
        while stack:
            l, w = stack.pop()
            largest = max(largest, w * (len(heights) - l))
        return largest
