914 X of a Kind in a Deck of Cards
=======================
[Problem description](https://leetcode.com/problems/x-of-a-kind-in-a-deck-of-cards/)

#### Difficulty
<span style="color:green">Easy</span>

#### Keywords
- Greatest common divisor

#### Idea
The key to this problem is to find the **greatest common divisor** for the counts of different kinds of cards. The solution here shows the implementation of the GCD function. Even better, Python provides the function in `fractions.gcd`.


#### Complexity
- Runtime: O(N)
- Space: O(1)

#### LC performance
- Runtime: 44 ms
- Memory usage: 13.4 MB

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def hasGroupsSizeX(self, deck: List[int]) -> bool:
        from collections import Counter
        
        counts = Counter(deck).values()
        
        def gcd(x, y):
            return y if x == 0 else gcd(y%x, x)
        
        g = None
        for c in counts:
            if not g:
                g = c
                continue
            g = gcd(g, c)
        
        return g >= 2
