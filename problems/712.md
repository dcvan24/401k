#### Idea
The idea of this problem is similar to [#72](https://leetcode.com/problems/edit-distance/), except that only deletion is allowed to the input strings. Similarly, we use a matrix to enumerate all the possible deletion strategies and corresponding ASCII cost. We denote the positions of currently traversing characters in `s1` and `s2` as `i` and `j`, respectiveliy. We also denote the current characters as `c1` and `c2` accordingly. The DP can be summarized as follows:

1. If `c1 == c2`, `DP(i, j) = DP(i - 1, j - 1)`
2. Otherwise, `DP(i, j) = min(DP(i - 1, j) + ASCII(c1), DP(i, j - 1) + ASCII(c2))`

When `c1 == c2`, we do not need additional deletions to make the strings equal, therefore the total cost remains the same as that of the last round. 

When `c1 != c2`, we can delete either `c1` or `c2`. We compare the cost associated with the alternatives, and select the one with less cost.

class Solution:
    def minimumDeleteSum(self, s1: str, s2: str) -> int:
        dp = [[0] * (len(s2) + 1) for _ in range(len(s1) + 1)]
        r, c = 0, 0
        for i in range(len(s1) + 1):    
            for j in range(len(s2) + 1):
                if i == 0 and j == 0:
                    continue
                if i == 0:
                    r += ord(s2[j - 1])
                    dp[i][j] = r
                elif j == 0:
                    c += ord(s1[i - 1])
                    dp[i][j] = c
                elif s1[i - 1] == s2[j - 1]:
                    dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1]
                else:
                    dp[i][j] = min(dp[i - 1][j] + ord(s1[i - 1]), dp[i][j - 1] + ord(s2[j - 1]))
        return dp[-1][-1]
