523 Continuous Subarray Sum
=======================
[Problem description](https://leetcode.com/problems/continuous-subarray-sum/)

#### Difficulty
<span style="color:#FABC60">Medium</span>

#### Keywords
- Dynamic programming

#### Idea
The code is the straigtforward approach - try all the possible subarrays and return true immediately if a  target subarray is found. The gotcha is that the `k` could be zero, in which case the modulo over zero is invalid and the algorithm should take care of this case. 

[This post](https://leetcode.com/problems/continuous-subarray-sum/discuss/275219/Python-solution) presents an O(N) solution with dynamic programming with O(N) space. The idea is to cache the modulo of the subarray sum over `k` at each position when traversing the array. When a specific modulo recurs, it indicates that removing the number at the corresponding position from the subarray will qualify the subarray.

#### Complexity
- Runtime: O($N^2$)
- Space: O(1) 
  
#### LC performance
- Runtime: 788 ms
- Memory usage: 13.5 MB

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def checkSubarraySum(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> bool:
        if len(nums) < 2:
            return False
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            s = nums[i]
            for j in range(i + 1, len(nums)):
                s += nums[j]
                if (k == 0 and s == k) or (k != 0 and s%k == 0):
                    return True
        return False
