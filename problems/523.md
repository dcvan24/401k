- [Cumulative sum](../categories/cumsum.md)

#### Idea
The code is the straigtforward approach - try all the possible subarrays and return true immediately if a target subarray is found. The gotcha is that the `k` could be zero, in which case the modulo over zero is invalid and the algorithm should take care of this case. 

[This post](https://leetcode.com/problems/continuous-subarray-sum/discuss/275219/Python-solution) presents an O(N) solution with dynamic programming with O(N) space. The idea is to cache the modulo of the subarray sum over `k` at each position when traversing the array. When a specific modulo recurs, it indicates that removing the number at the corresponding position from the subarray will qualify the subarray.

#### Complexity
- Runtime: O($N^2$)
- Space: O(1) 
  
#### LC performance
- Runtime: 64 ms
- Memory usage: 13.2 MB

```python
class Solution:
    def checkSubarraySum(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> bool:
        # use a hash table to keep track of subarray ending positions. The key 
        # is the mod of cumulative sum over the given `k`. Initially, the cumsum 
        # is 0 and thus its mod over k is 0 too. The subarray ends at the 
        # position right before the first position of the given array, which is 
        # -1
        pos = {0: -1}
        cumsum = 0
        
        # go over the numbers in the given array
        for i, n in enumerate(nums):
            # add to the cumulative sum
            cumsum += n
            if k != 0:
                # take the mod of cumsum over `k`
                cumsum %= k
            # we use the mod as the key and track the ending position of the 
            # subarray associated with the mod. If the same mod is found in the 
            # hash table, it means there was a subarray `sum(nums[0:i])%k == mod`, 
            # and now there is another `sum(nums[0:j])%k == mod`. As a result, 
            # `sum(num[i:j])%k = (sum(nums[0:j]) - sum(nums[0:i]))%k == 0`, thus
            # the sum of `num[i:j]` is a multiple of the given `k`.
            if cumsum in pos:
                # by the given definition, a subarray must have at least two 
                # numbers, so we check if the span between the starting and 
                # ending positions is greater than 1. 
                if i - pos[cumsum] > 1:
                    return True
            else:
                pos[cumsum] = i
        
        return False
