397 Integer Replacement    
=======================
[Problem description](https://leetcode.com/problems/integer-replacement/)

#### Difficulty
<span style="color:#FABC60">Medium</span>

#### Keywords
- Greedy
  
#### Idea
The key is to recognize that ***n* collapses most rapidly if it is an even number whenever possible after each step**. Otherwise, it must waste another step to perform a linear operation to increase/decrease *n* to make it an even number. Since there are only two options when *n* is odd, we check both results after the linear operation, and opt for the one that turns *n* into an even number. 

#### Complexity
- Runtime: O(N) 
- Space: O(1)
  
#### LC performance
- Runtime: 28 ms
- Memory usage: 13.3 MB

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def integerReplacement(self, n: int) -> int:
        steps = 0
        while n != 1:
            if n % 2 == 0:
                n /= 2
            else:
                n = (n - 1) if (n - 1) % 2 == 0 or (n - 1) == 1 else (n + 1)
            steps += 1
        return steps
