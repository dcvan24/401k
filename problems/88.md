        Do not return anything, modify nums1 in-place instead.
        """

        # means all the numbers in `nums2` are merged and others in `nums1` are 
        # in the right position, so we don't need to take care of that case. 
        # Instead, if `j >= 0`, that means there are some numbers in `nums2` not
        # merged, and we need to merge them in.
