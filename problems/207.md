207 Course Schedule  
=======================
[Problem description](https://leetcode.com/problems/course-schedule/)

#### Difficulty
<span style="color:#FABC60">Medium</span>

#### Keywords
- Topological sort
- [Kahn's algorithm](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/topological-sorting-indegree-based-solution/)
  
#### Idea
The problem actually asks **if there is a valid topological ordering of classes respecting the given course pre-requisites**. Hence, the actual topological ordering does not really matter, as long as it contains all the vertices. Using Kahn's algorithm, we can determine if a valid topological ordering exists by checking if all the vertices are included in the result ordering. If not, it means there is no possible topological ordering (i.e., the graph is not a DAG), and we should return false in this case. Otherwise, we return true.

class Solution:
    def canFinish(self, numCourses: int, prerequisites: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
        if not prerequisites:
            return True
        
        from collections import deque
        
        ind, deps = {i: 0 for i in range(numCourses)}, {}
        for v, u in prerequisites:
            ind[v] += 1
            deps.setdefault(u, []).append(v)
            
        q = deque(v for v, d in ind.items() if d == 0)
        count = 0

        while q:
            v = q.popleft()
            count += 1
            for d in deps.get(v, []):
                ind[d] -= 1
                if ind[d] == 0:
                    q += d,
        return count == numCourses
