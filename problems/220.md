=======================
[Problem description](https://leetcode.com/problems/contains-duplicate-iii/)

#### Difficulty

#### Keywords

- [Caching](../categories/caching.md)

#### Idea
The key to this problem is to **keep a reversed index of the numbers in array to allow value-to-index search**. The caveat is that using the reversed index in general will cause TLE on LeetCode, since it takes O($k^2$) to negate the existence of the desired duplicates, which is too costly for big data input especially $k$ is much greater than $t$. 

Hence, we need to optimize for the case when $t<k$. The idea is to search the space $[-t, t]$ linearly to find if there exists any qualified number in the reversed index. With the optimization, the negation only takes $O(2tk)$, which is much less than $O(k^2)$ when $t$ is trivial as compared to $k$, in which case the runtime complexity is approximately linear to $k$. 

#### Complexity
- Runtime: O($N^2$)
- Space: O(N)
  
#### LC performance
- Runtime: 40 ms
- Memory usage: 15.4 MB

#### Code

```python
class Solution:
    def containsNearbyAlmostDuplicate(self, nums: List[int], k: int, t: int) -> bool:
        ridx = {}
        
        for i, n in enumerate(nums):
            if t <= k:
                for v in range(-t, t + 1):
                    if n + v in ridx and abs(i - ridx[n + v]) <= k:
                        return True
            else:
                for key, val in ridx.items():
                    if abs(n - key) <= t and abs(i - val) <= k:
                        return True
            ridx[n] = i
                
        return False
