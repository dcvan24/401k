#### Idea
The problem can be solved as a variant of **counting the number of contiguous subarrays**, except for the condition that every subarray must be **arithmetic**. Specifically, **if `A` is an arithmetic sequence, any subsequence with a length over 3 in `A` is also arithemtic**. Hence, given an arithmetic sequence, we need to find how many arithmetic subsequences in the given sequence. 

In implementation, we start from the smallest arithmetic sequence with three numbers. If the difference between every pair of adjacent numbers is same, we grow the sequence from the right with the next number in the given sequence, and also proceed the DP. If the arithmetic condition is violated, we reset the DP and restart from the smallest arithmetic sequence again. The total number of arithmetic subsequences will accrue, although these subsequences can be disjoint in the given sequence.

class Solution:
    def numberOfArithmeticSlices(self, A: List[int]) -> int:
        if len(A) < 3:
            return 0
        
        dp = [0] * len(A)
        total = 0
        for i in range(2, len(A)):
            if A[i] - A[i - 1] == A[i - 1] - A[i - 2]:
                dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + 1
                total += dp[i]
                
        return total
