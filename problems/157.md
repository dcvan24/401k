# Below is an example of how the read4 API can be called.
file = File("abcdefghijk") # File is "abcdefghijk", initially file pointer (fp) points to 'a'
buf = [' '] * 4 # Create buffer with enough space to store characters
read4(buf) # read4 returns 4. Now buf = ['a','b','c','d'], fp points to 'e'
read4(buf) # read4 returns 4. Now buf = ['e','f','g','h'], fp points to 'i'
read4(buf) # read4 returns 3. Now buf = ['i','j','k',...], fp points to end of file
