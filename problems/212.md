212 Word Break II
=======================
[Problem description](https://leetcode.com/problems/word-search-ii/)

#### Difficulty
<span style="color:red">Hard</span>

#### Keywords
- [Depth-first Search](../categories/dfs.md)
- [Trie](../categories/trie.md)
- [Backtracking](../categories/backtracking.md)
  
#### Idea
The key is to put the dictionary into a trie to save space while speed up the word lookup. If making the dictionary a set, it will take O(MN) space where M is the average word length. This is space inefficient when there are many words sharing prefixes. More importantly, by putting the dictionary into a set, there will be O($N^2$) full word matching and take a total of O($MN^2$) time, which is also inefficient especially when there are many words sharing prefixes.

#### Complexity
- Runtime: O($N^2$)
- Space: O(MN) where M is the average word length
  
#### LC performance
- Runtime: 344 ms
- Memory usage: 36.1 MB

#### Code
```python
from collections import defaultdict

class TrieNode:
    
    def __init__(self):
        self.children = defaultdict(TrieNode)
        self.is_word = False


class Solution:
    def findWords(self, board: List[List[str]], words: List[str]) -> List[str]:
        # in case the board is empty, return empty list
        if not board or not board[0]:
            return []

        # store the given into a trie
        root = TrieNode()
        for w in words:
            n = root
            for c in w:
                n = n.children[c]
            n.is_word = True
        
        # use DFS to traverse the board and find words in the given dictionary
        m, n = len(board), len(board[0])
        # a visited matrix to keep track of visited cells and avoid cycles
        visited = [[False] * n for _ in range(m)]
        # use a set to store the results without duplicates
        res = set()
        
        def dfs(i, j, node, w):
            # stop the search if 
            # 1) the indices are out of range
            # 2) the current cell has been visited
            # 3) the letter does not consist a word with its prefix
            if i < 0 or i == m or j < 0 or j == n or visited[i][j] or board[i][j] not in node.children:
                return
            # mark the cell as visited
            visited[i][j] = True
            # find the next trie node 
            node = node.children[board[i][j]]
            # add the current letter to the prefix 
            w += board[i][j]
            # check if the current prefix is a full word
            if node.is_word:
                res.add(w)
            # search in four directions
            for di, dj in [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]:
                dfs(i + di, j + dj, node, w)
            # finish visiting current cell and resume it as unvisited
            visited[i][j] = False
        
        # start the search from every cell on the board
        for i in range(m):
            for j in range(n):
                dfs(i, j, root, '')
        
        return list(res)
