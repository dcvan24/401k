212 Word Break II
=======================
[Problem description](https://leetcode.com/problems/word-search-ii/)

#### Difficulty

#### Keywords
- [Depth-first Search](../categories/dfs.md)
- [Trie](../categories/trie.md)
- [Backtracking](../categories/backtracking.md)
  
#### Idea
The key is to put the dictionary into a trie to save space while speed up the word lookup. If making the dictionary a set, it will take O(MN) space where M is the average word length. This is space inefficient when there are many words sharing prefixes. More importantly, by putting the dictionary into a set, there will be O($N^2$) full word matching and take a total of O($MN^2$) time, which is also inefficient especially when there are many words sharing prefixes.

#### Complexity
- Runtime: O($N^2$)
- Space: O(MN) where M is the average word length
  
#### LC performance
- Runtime: 352 ms
- Memory usage: 35.9 MB

#### Code
```python

    def findWords(self, board: List[List[str]], words: List[str]) -> List[str]:

            for c in w:
                n = p.children.get(c)
                if not n:
                    n = TrieNode(c)
                    p.children[c] = n
                p = n
            p.is_complete = True
        
        res, visited = set(), [[False] * len(board[i]) for i in range(len(board))]

            if n.is_complete:
                res.add(word)
            dfs(i - 1, j, n, word, board, visited, res)
            dfs(i + 1, j, n, word, board, visited, res)

                dfs(i, j, root, '', board, visited, res)
