#### Idea
A graph is given in this problem wherein each airport is a vertex and each ticket is an edge. The task is to reconstruct the itinerary using *every* given ticket, i.e. every airport must be reached, otherwise there will be tickets left unused. Hence, it is anagolous to finding an **Eulerian path** in the given graph on which every vertex is visited *exactly once*. This problem is a variant since an airport (vertex) may be visited for multiple times and there can be multiple directed edges between two vertices. We can map the problem to the original problem by treating different visits to the same airport as different vertices, in which case the indegree (flight arriving at the airport) and outdegree (flight departing the airport) will be equal to 1. 

The most efficient algorithm for finding an Eulerian path is the **Hierholzer's algorithm**, which uses DFS and backtracking in combination. It runs DFS to traverse the graph, putting every visited vertex into a stack and then removing every traversed edge. If there are no more edges to proceed but vertices left unvisited, the algorithm backtracks to the vertex *V* that has other edge(s) and restarts the traversal from there. Since it is guaranteed that there is an Eulerian path in the graph, there must be a cycle starting from *V* and the traversal will return to *V* eventually (, otherwise there doesn't exist an Eulerian path since *V* must be visited multiple times to traverse the entire graph). Once the traversal returns to *V*, we will have a path that covers every vertex in the cycle. By appending the previously visited vertices in order to the end of the path, we get the full Eulerian path. Simply put, the algorithm looks for sub-path greedily and concatenates all the sub-paths in order to construct the full Eulerian path. With this algorithm, since every vertice will be traversed once and it requires a stack for holding previously visited vertices, the runtime and space complexity are O(V) and O(V), respectively. 

[Here](https://leetcode.com/problems/reconstruct-itinerary/discuss/78825/Clear-Python-DFS) is another clear solution using a recursive approach.

        for s, d in tickets:
            g.setdefault(s, []).append(d)
        for k, v in g.items():
            g[k] = sorted(v, reverse=True)
        
        # select 'JFK' as the starting vertex
        stack, visited, path = ['JFK'], [], []
        
        # run the algorithm until all the vertices are covered
        while g:
            cur = stack.pop()
            path += cur, 
            next_stops = g.get(cur, [])
            if not next_stops and g: # when reaching a sink but there are still vertices uncovered
                # backtrack to the vertex with outbound edge(s)
                while cur not in g:
                    # stash visited vertices
                    visited += path.pop(),
                    cur = path[-1]
                next_stops = g.get(cur, [])
            if next_stops:
                # put the next hop onto the stack for traversal and burn the bridge
                stack += next_stops.pop(),
                if not next_stops:
                    del g[cur]
        # put the last vertex to the end of the path
        if stack:
            path += stack.pop(),
        # put the stashed vertices back to the path
        while visited:
            path += visited.pop(),
        
        return path
