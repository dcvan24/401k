# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.left = None
#         self.right = None
from collections import deque

class Solution:
    def isCompleteTree(self, root: TreeNode) -> bool:
        # traverse the tree in level order and keep track of the sequence number 
        # of each node, initially 1 for root
        q = deque([(root, 1)])
        # keep counting the number of nodes being traversed
        count = 0
        while q:
            n, seq = q.popleft()
            if not n:
                continue
            count += 1
            # for a complete binary tree, every node will be traversed in the 
            # level order from top to bottom and from left to right, so the 
            # sequence number of each node should be equal to the count
            if seq != count:
                return False
            # only traverse non-null children, and calculate their sequence 
            # number ahead, which is `2 * seq` for the left child and 
            # `2 * seq + 1` for the right. 
            if n.left:
                q.append((n.left, 2 * seq))
            if n.right:
                q.append((n.right, 2 * seq + 1))
