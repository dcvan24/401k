        A classic Dutch national flag problem, wherein there are exact three 
        distinct items to sort in the array. The basic idea is to use three 
        pointers to keep track of the boundaries between distinct items. When 
        scanning the array, we swap the items at the boundaries if necessary, 
        and move the boundary pointers accordingly to always make them point to 
        the items at the boundaries. 
        """
        # `i` points to the right boundary of the smallest items
        # `j` points to the right boundary of the items in the middle
        # `k` points to the left boundary of the largest items
        i = j = 0
        k = len(nums) - 1
        # move `j` to scan the array linearly before it meets `k`
        while j <= k:
            # if the current item is the smallest one
            if nums[j] == 0:
                # swap it with the item at `i`, since the item at the right 
                # boundary of the smallest items is the item in the middle
                nums[i], nums[j] = nums[j], nums[i]
                # move the right boundary of the smallest item to the right
                i += 1
                # move forward `j` to continue scanning
                j += 1
            # if the current item is the largest one
            elif nums[j] == 2:
                # swap it with the item at `k`, since the item at the left 
                # boundary of the largest items is the item in the middle
                nums[j], nums[k] = nums[k], nums[j]
                # move the left boundary of the smallest item to the left
                k -= 1
                # since the item just being swapped to `j` has yet to be 
                # scanned, and we don't know which category it belongs to, we 
                # stay at current `j` to scan it in the next round
            # if the current item is the one in the middle
            else:
                # move the right boundary of the middle item to the right, and 
                # continue scanning
