987 Vertical Order Traversal of a Binary Tree    
=======================
[Problem description](https://leetcode.com/problems/product-of-array-except-self/)

#### Difficulty
<span style="color:#FABC60">Medium</span>

#### Keywords
- Tree
  
#### Idea
The key is to keep track of the location of every node in the tree respecting its **depth** and **horizontal index**. In implementation, we can use a hash table to group the nodes by their horizontal index, and within each group we can sort the nodes by their depth. Since the locations of tree nodes are tracked and sorting will be used, the traversal order is unlikely to affect the result, but may impact the complexity. Pre-order or in-order traversal is more natural, since the resulting order of nodes is likely partially sorted, therefore the average complexity for sorting is lower. 

#### Complexity
- Runtime: ??
- Space: O(N)
  
#### LC performance
- Runtime: 36 ms
- Memory usage: 13.5 MB

#### Code

```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.left = None
#         self.right = None

class Solution:
    def verticalTraversal(self, root: TreeNode) -> List[List[int]]:
        res = {}
        
        def traverse(n, l, d):
            if not n:
                return
            res.setdefault(l, []).append((d, n.val))
            d += 1
            traverse(n.left, l - 1, d)
            traverse(n.right, l + 1, d)
            
        traverse(root, 0, 0)
        return [[n for _, n in sorted(vals)] for _, vals in sorted(res.items())]
```
