        """
        The idea is similar to #680 - there is allowed to be at most one 
        character off between the given strings, and we need to ensure the rest 
        of them are identical. 
        """
        # if one string is longer than the other by more than 1, it is 
        # impossible to make an one-off edit to make them match
        if abs(len(s) - len(t)) > 1:
            return False
        # assume `t` is always longer than `s` if not equal in length, in order 
        # to reduce the possibilities and simplify the code
        if len(s) > len(t):
            s, t = t, s
        
        for i in range(len(s)):
            # when difference is found at a position, edit is needed
            if s[i] != t[i]:
                # if the given strings have the same length, the edit is to 
                # update the character at current position, so we need to 
                # ensure the rest of the given strings match each other
                if len(s) == len(t):
                    return s[i + 1:] == t[i + 1:]
                # otherwise, `t` is longer than `s`, and we can delete the 
                # different character in `t` and check if the rest are the same
                return s[i:] == t[i + 1:]
        
        # if no difference found, it means `s` and `t` are identical or `s` is 
        # a substring of `t`. The former case is not qualified since the edit 
        # distance in this case is 0. In the latter case, we check if we can 
        # make the strings match by inserting a character to `s`
        return len(s) + 1 == len(t)
