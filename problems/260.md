#### Keywords
- Bitwise operation
  
#### Idea
The problem is an advanced version of [Single Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/single-number/). To solve the simpler version using constant space, we leverage the XOR operation since all but one number repeat and those repeated ones will cancel out with XOR. In this problem, there are two numbers occurring only once but others twice, so simply using XOR results the XOR between these two numbers, i.e. `a^b` if `a` and `b` are the target numbers. However, this result is still meaningful since **it indicates the bits where `a` and `b` differ**. With this evidence, we can **divide the given numbers into two groups** by checking any bit where `a` and `b` differ from each other, and these two numbers must fall into the different groups. As a result, we get two Single Number problems and simply apply XOR to find the two numbers individually using constant space.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def singleNumber(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        xor = 0
        for n in nums:
            xor ^= n
            
        shift = 0
        while xor & 1 != 1:
            shift += 1
            xor >>= 1
        
        na, nb = 0, 0
        for n in nums:
            if (n >> shift) & 1:
                na ^= n
            else:
                nb ^= n
        return [na, nb]
