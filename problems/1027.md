#### Keywords

- [Memoization](../categories/memo.md)

#### Idea
This DP is to **memoize the length of arithmetics with all the possible step sizes so far during the traversal**. In other word, we keep looking for the longest arithmetics in sub-arrays ending at every index *i* until reaching the end of the given array. For every element in the array, any element at *j* in prior to it can form a pair with it with certain step size. We memoize such pairs for the sub-array ending at *i* by their step size. As the traversal proceeds, we can always find such pairs with certain step size, so we can check if the preceding pair/arithmetic starting from *j* with the step size exists. If so, we increment the length of the found pair/arithmetic and memoize it as the length of the possible arithmetic ending at *i*, and update the global maximum length. Otherwise, we find a new pair and thus memoize it too.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def longestArithSeqLength(self, A: List[int]) -> int:
        dp = [{} for _ in A]
        max_len = 0
        
        for i in range(1, len(A)):
            for j in range(i):
                step = A[i] - A[j]
                cur_len = dp[j].get(step, 1) + 1
                dp[i][step] = cur_len 
                max_len = max(max_len, cur_len)
        
        return max_len
