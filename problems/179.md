179 Largest Number
=======================
[Problem description](https://leetcode.com/problems/largest-number/)

#### Difficulty

#### Keywords
- Sorting
- Comparator
- String manipulation

#### Idea
The key to this problem is to recognize that we can sort the numbers by comparing the values of concatenations in different orders for every pair of numbers in comparison (i.e. `x + y` vs `y + x` if `x` and `y` are the two numbers being compared). 

The gotcha is that there could be leading zeros in the result, which need to be removed, and the algorithm also needs to handle the case in which there are duplicate zeros if the final result is `0`.

*For Python3*, since the `cmp` parameter has been removed from the `sorted` function, the `sorted` function does not support comparator function directly but only via `functools.cmp_to_key`, which transforms the comparator function into a wrapper object that can be used as the `key` of the `sorted` function. 

#### Complexity
- Runtime: O(NlogN)
- Space: O(1) 
  
#### LC performance
- Runtime: 44 ms
- Memory usage: 13.3 MB

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def largestNumber(self, nums: List[int]) -> str:
        from functools import cmp_to_key
        return ''.join(sorted(map(str, nums), 
                              key=cmp_to_key(lambda x, y: int(y + x) - int(x + y)))
                      ).lstrip('0') or '0'
```
