#### Idea
The key to this problem is to recognize that we can sort the numbers by comparing the values of concatenations in different orders for every pair of numbers in comparison (i.e. `x + y` vs `y + x` if `x` and `y` are the two numbers being compared). 

The gotcha is that there could be leading zeros in the result, which need to be removed, and the algorithm also needs to handle the case in which there are duplicate zeros if the final result is `0`.

*For Python3*, since the `cmp` parameter has been removed from the `sorted` function, the `sorted` function does not support comparator function directly but only via `functools.cmp_to_key`, which transforms the comparator function into a wrapper object that can be used as the `key` of the `sorted` function. 

#### Complexity

#### Code

##### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def largestNumber(self, nums: List[int]) -> str:
        from functools import cmp_to_key
        return ''.join(sorted(map(str, nums), 
                              key=cmp_to_key(lambda x, y: int(y + x) - int(x + y)))
                      ).lstrip('0') or '0'
```

##### Java
```java
class Solution {
    public String largestNumber(int[] nums) {
        // convert the given int array into string array to sort alphabetically
        String[] strs = new String[nums.length];
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i ++) {
            strs[i] = String.valueOf(nums[i]);
        }
        
        // Since we want to put numbers with larger leading digits in front, we 
        // want to sort them roughly from largest to smallest. However, in 
        // string comparison, longer strings always win if the prefixing digits 
        // are equal. This may not always what we want since it may result in 
        // smaller number. For instance, given `[3, 30]`, `30` will be in front 
        // of `3` since it is longer, forming `303` as the result. But `330` is 
        // actually the largest number. 
        //
        // To address this, we simply try different orders for every pair of 
        // strings to find out the larger one. 
        Arrays.sort(strs, 
                   (o1, o2) -> ((o2 + o1).compareTo(o1 + o2)));
        
        // if the largest value is 0, then the largest number must be zero
        if (strs[0].equals("0")) {
            return "0";
        }
        
        // Concatenate the strings in order
        StringBuilder builder = new StringBuilder();
        for (String s: strs) {
            builder.append(s);
        }
        
        return builder.toString(); 
    }
}
