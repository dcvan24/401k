539 Minimum Time Difference
=======================
[Problem description](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-time-difference/)

#### Difficulty
<span style="color:#FABC60">Medium</span>

#### Keywords
- Precursor in array
- String manipulation

#### Idea
The tricky part is that you need to check the difference between the last and first time points in the sorted list, since the first time points could be the time of the next day (+24 hours). 

The final code submission reuses the given list in the parameter to improve the memory usage from the 5th percentile to the 40th, which I personally don't think worthwhile. 

#### Complexity
- Runtime: O(NlogN)
- Space: O(1)

#### LC performance
- Runtime: 64 ms
- Memory usage: 14.6 MB

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def findMinDifference(self, timePoints: List[str]) -> int:
        for i in range(len(timePoints)):
            h, m = map(lambda x: int(x), timePoints[i].split(':'))
            timePoints[i] = h * 60 + m
        timePoints.sort()
        pre, min_diff = timePoints[0], 24 * 60
        for p in timePoints[1:]:
            min_diff = min(min_diff, p - pre)
            pre = p
        return min(min_diff, timePoints[0] + 24 * 60 - timePoints[-1])   
```
