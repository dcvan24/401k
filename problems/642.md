#### Keywords
- [Trie](../categories/trie.md)
- [Heap](../categories/heap.md)
  
#### Idea


#### Complexity
- Runtime: O(1) for auto-completion, O(MlogM) for updating a sentence, O(NlogN) for adding a sentence
- Space: N/A
  
#### LC performance
- Runtime: 832 ms
- Memory usage: 19.9 MB

#### Code
```python
"""
There are two design goals: 1) minimize the cost for auto-completion, since it 
is likely the most frequent operation in the system; 2) improve storage 
efficiency in order to scale to a large number of sentences being added to the 
system over time. 

To achieve 1), we can have the existing sentences in the system 
sorted by the number they being typed a priori, so that the auto-completion 
queries can be fulfilled instantly. The cost for sorting the sentences is only 
paid when new sentences being added to the system and it is a one-time cost. 

For 2), we can use a trie to store the sentences in the system, to avoid storing 
duplicate characters. 

In implementation, we use a trie with a max heap in each trie node to build the 
auto-complete system.
