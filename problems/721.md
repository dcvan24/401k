```python
class Solution:
    def accountsMerge(self, accounts: List[List[str]]) -> List[List[str]]:
        # group accounts by the email addresses associated with them
        emails = {}
        for i, acct in enumerate(accounts):
            for j in range(1, len(acct)):
                emails.setdefault(acct[j], []).append(i)
        
        merged = []
        visited = set()
        for email, indices in emails.items():
            # if the email has been visited, skip it
            if email in visited or not indices:
                continue
            # use DFS to find all the related emails 
            stack, acct = [email], [accounts[indices[0]][0]]
            while stack:
                cur = stack.pop()
                # skip the email if already visited
                if cur in visited:
                    continue
                # mark the email as visited
                visited.add(cur)
                # append the email to the account
                acct.append(cur)
                # go over all the accounts with this email address, to find 
                # other email addresses
                for idx in emails[cur]:
                    for e in accounts[idx][1:]:
                        stack.append(e)
            # once all the email addresses associated to this account found, add 
            # the account to the result
            merged.append(acct)
        # sort the email addresses for every account as requested
        return [[acct[0]] + sorted(acct[1:]) for acct in merged]
```

##### Union find
```python
class Solution:
    def accountsMerge(self, accounts: List[List[str]]) -> List[List[str]]:
        # utilities for union-find
        parents = list(range(len(accounts)))
        ranks = [0] * len(accounts)
        
        def find(x):
            if x != parents[x]:
                parents[x] = find(parents[x])
            return parents[x]
        
        def union(u, v):
            pu, pv = find(u), find(v)
            if pu == pv:
                return
            if ranks[pu] == ranks[pv]:
                parents[pu] = pv
                ranks[pv] += 1
            elif ranks[pu] < ranks[pv]:
                parents[pu] = pv
            else:
                parents[pv] = pu
                
        # group accounts by email addresses associated with them, in which each 
        # account is identified by its index in the given list
        occurs = {}
        for i, acct in enumerate(accounts):
            for email in acct[1:]:
                occurs.setdefault(email, []).append(i)

        # union the accounts
        for indices in occurs.values():
            if len(indices) > 1:
                for i in range(1, len(indices)):
                    union(indices[i - 1], indices[i])
        
        # find the root of each acccount and add email addresses to it 
        res = {}
        for i, acct in enumerate(accounts):
            res.setdefault(find(i), [acct[0]]).extend(acct[1:])
        
        # remove duplicates and sort the email addresses for every account
        return [acct[:1] + sorted(set(acct[1:])) for acct in res.values()]
