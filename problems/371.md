#### Idea
The key to the problem is to use XOR (`^`) and AND (`&`) operations in combinations to calculate the sum recursively - the XOR operation adds up the bits where either bit is 0 or 1, while the AND operation handles the case where both bits are 0 or 1 and the carry when both bits are 1. For instance, to add `2` and `3`, they are denoted as `010` and `011` in bits, respectively. The XOR adds up the rightmost bits of the two numbers where `2` has `0` and `3` has `1` at that position, resulting `001`. The AND operations adds up the other bits. For the bits in the middle, both numbers have `1` and adding them up carries 1 to the next bit on the left. Similarly, adding the leftmost `0`s of both numbers results `0`. Since the result of the AND operation contains carry-over bits, they need to be shifted to the left by 1 to fulfil the carry-overs. This process continues until there is no carry-overs, in which case the result of the last XOR operation is the final result of the sum. 

The problem also examines the mastery of the `NOT` (`~`) operation specifically when either or both numbers are negative, in which case bits of the negative number(s) need to be flipped before any bitwise operations. As a note, the negation of a number, for instance `a`, is `~a + 1`.

class Solution:
    def getSum(self, a, b):
        if b == 0:
            return a 
        carry = ctypes.c_int32(a & b)
        return self.getSum(a ^ b, carry.value << 1)
