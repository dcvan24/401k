# class ListNode:

#         self.next = None

class Solution:
    def oddEvenList(self, head: ListNode) -> ListNode:
        # if there are fewer than two nodes, there are only a single odd and 
        # even node accordingly, so return the list without any change
        if not head or not head.next:
            return head
        # the first node is the head of the odd nodes
        odd = head
        # the second node is the head of the even nodes. Use an additional 
        # pointer pointing to the head of the even nodes, since they need to be
        # appended to the end of the odd nodes in the end
        even_head = even = head.next
        # when the current even node and its next one exist
        while even and even.next:
            odd.next = even.next
