221 Maximal Square
=======================
[Problem description](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximal-square/)

#### Difficulty
<span style="color:#FABC60">Medium</span>

#### Keywords
- Dynamic programming

#### Idea
This DP caches the width of the square at **horizontal, vertical and diagonal dimensions**. The DP keeps track of the minimum stretch among all these dimensions, which will be the width of the square being formed so far at the current position. We also keep a global variable to keep track of the maximum width globally. The result will be the square of the maximum width. 

#### Complexity
- Runtime: O(MN)
- Space: O(MN)

#### LC performance

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def maximalSquare(self, matrix: List[List[str]]) -> int:
        dp = [[0] * len(r) for r in matrix]
        
        max_len = 0
        for i in range(len(matrix)):
            for j in range(len(matrix[i])):
                if matrix[i][j] == '0':
                    continue
                if i == 0 or j == 0:
                    dp[i][j] = 1
                else:
                    dp[i][j] = min(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i][j - 1], dp[i - 1][j - 1]) + 1
                max_len = max(max_len, dp[i][j])
        return max_len ** 2
