# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:

#         self.val = x

        Given a complete tree, every level of the tree must be filled except the
        last level. The total number of nodes above the last level is `2^d - 1` 
        wherein `d` is the depth of the tree. Herein, the problem is simplified 
        to finding the number of leaves of the tree. 

        Since the leaves are populated from left to right, we can use binary 
        search to find the first position where the leaf is missing, and the 
        index is the number of leaves in the tree. The final result is the sum 
        of number of nodes above the last level and the number of leaves
