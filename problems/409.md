409 Longest Palindrome    
=======================
[Problem description](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-palindrome/)

#### Difficulty
<span style="color:green">Easy</span>

#### Keywords
- Palindrome

#### Idea
The pitfall is that **you don't have to use all the given letters!** Therefore, when encountering letters with an odd number count, you can pick the largest even number of this letter, which is the count minus 1, to form the palindrome. The existence of letters with an odd number count only matters ;at the end, since you can only pick one of these letters as the center of the palindrome. Hence, if there is no such letter, just return the sum of all the letter counts. Otherwise, increment the total by 1 with the additional centering letter. 

#### Complexity
- Runtime: O(N)
- Space: O(1)

#### LC performance
- Runtime: 28 ms
- Memory usage: 13.2 MB

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def longestPalindrome(self, s: str) -> int:
        from collections import Counter
        
        total, odd_exist = 0, False
        for c in Counter(s).values():
            if c%2 == 0:
                total += c
            else:
                odd_exist = True
                total += c - 1
        
        return total + (1 if odd_exist else 0)
