#### Code
```python
import random 


class Solution:

    def __init__(self, w: List[int]):
        # calculate the cumulative sum of the weights that captures the weight 
        # distribution for each number 
        for i in range(1, len(w)):
            w[i] += w[i - 1]
        self.w = w

    def pickIndex(self) -> int:
        w = self.w
        # sample a random number from the range [0, sum(weight) - 1], which has 
        # an even chance to get picked as other numbers and must fall on certain 
        # position in the cumulative sum array. The index of that position is 
        # the weighted random number 
        t = random.randint(0, w[-1] - 1)
        
        # since the cumulative sum array is sorted, we can find the position of 
        # the newly picked random number using binary search
        lo, hi = 0, len(w)
        while lo < hi:
            mid = (lo + hi)//2
            if t < w[mid]:
                hi = mid
            else:
                lo = mid + 1
        return lo
