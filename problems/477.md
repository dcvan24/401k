#### Difficulty
<span style="color:#FABC60">Medium</span>

#### Keywords
- [Bitwise](../categories/bitwise.md)

#### Idea

#### Complexity
- Runtime: O(MlogN) wherein `M` is the size of the array and `N` is the max bit length
- Space: O(N)

#### LC performance
- Runtime: 628 ms
- Memory usage: 15.1 MB

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def totalHammingDistance(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        if not nums:
            return 0
        
        # find the max bit length in the given array
        bits = [0] * max(n.bit_length() for n in nums)
        # count the numbers with the bit set at each bit
        for n in nums:
            i = 0
            while n:
                bits[i] += n%2
                n >>= 1
                i += 1
        
        # count the hamming distance at each bit and sum them up
        return sum(c*(len(nums) - c) for c in bits)
```
