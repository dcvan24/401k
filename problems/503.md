503 Next Greater Element II   
=======================
[Problem description](https://leetcode.com/problems/next-greater-element-ii/)

#### Difficulty
<span style="color:#FABC60">Medium</span>

#### Keywords
- Monotonic decreasing stack
  
#### Idea
The same idea with [#496](496.md) except that there could be duplicates, so the indices need to be handled carefully. 


#### Complexity
- Runtime: O(N)
- Space: O(N)
  
#### LC performance
- Runtime: 308 ms
- Memory usage: 21.7 MB

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def nextGreaterElements(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        res = [-1] * len(nums)
        stack, indices = [], []
        
        for _ in range(2):
            for i, n in enumerate(nums):
                while stack and stack[-1] < n:
                    stack.pop()
                    res[indices.pop()] = n
                stack += n,
                indices += i,
        return res
```
