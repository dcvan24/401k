#### Difficulty

#### Keywords
- Dynamic programming
- Memoization

#### Idea
At the core, this is a combination sum problem similar to [#39](39.md) except that this problem does not ask for the specific combinations but only the total count. Furthermore, the search space is very large up to $f^d$, therefore it will be time-consuming to search the whole space. We could prune the search space by checking if the target still falls in the range of the possible sum with given dices, in order to reduce the time complexity to certain extent. More importantly, there are many duplicate search branches that can be avoided using **memoization**. The dynamic program is as below:

```
DP(0, 0) = 1, if target = 0
DP(d, t) = sum([DP(d - 1, t - v) for v in range(1, f + 1) if t - v > 0])
```

Here `d`, `t` and `v` are the number of dices left, target and the value on a face of a die, respectively. Initially, if the target is `0`, there is one possible roll to reach the target, i.e., doing nothing. For any other target `t`, we use the value of every face `v` of a die to see if it is possible to sum up to `t - v` with the dices left if `t - v > 0`, and sum up all the number of possibilities. 


#### Complexity
- Runtime: O($d\times f\times target$)
- Space: O($d\times target$)
  
#### LC performance
- Runtime: 136 ms
- Memory usage: 16 MB

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def numRollsToTarget(self, d: int, f: int, target: int) -> int:
        dp = [[-1] * (target + 1) for _ in range(d + 1)]
        mod = 10 ** 9 + 7
        
        def recurse(num_dices, target):
            if num_dices == 0:
                return 1 if target == 0 else 0
            if target > num_dices * f or target < num_dices:
                return 0
            res = 0
            num_dices -= 1
            for v in range(1, f + 1):
                t = target - v
                if t < 0:
                    continue
                if dp[num_dices][t] == -1:
                    dp[num_dices][t] = recurse(num_dices, t)
                res = (res + dp[num_dices][t])%mod
            return res
        
        return recurse(d, target)
