11 Container With Most Water
=======================
[Problem description](https://leetcode.com/problems/container-with-most-water/)

#### Difficulty
<span style="color:#FABC60">Medium</span>

#### Keywords
- [Pointer](../categories/pointer.md)
  
#### Idea
The key is that **the lower boundary determines the size of water body, and moving to a higher one potentially increases the size**. With this understanding, we can use two pointers to scan the height array from the two ends - the pointer moves towards the other end **only if it is the lower boundary**. The pointers scan the array in linear time, therefore the time and space complexity are O(N) and O(1), respectively. 

#### Complexity
- Runtime: O(N)
- Space: O(1)
  
#### LC performance
- Runtime: 64 ms
- Memory usage: 14.1 MB

#### Code

```python
class Solution:
    def maxArea(self, height: List[int]) -> int:
        l, r = 0, len(height) - 1
        max_area = 0
        while l < r:
            max_area = max(max_area, min(height[l], height[r]) * (r - l))
            if height[l] <  height[r]:
                l += 1
            else:
                r -= 1
        return max_area
```
