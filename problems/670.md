            # occurrence is after the current position
            for d in range(9, n, -1):
                # if such digit exists, swap the two digits, so that the greater 
                # can be placed at the frontmost possible to maximize the value 
                # of the new number; meanwhile, since the smaller is swapped to 
                # the hindmost possible, it has the least effect on decreasing 
                # the new number value
                if last.get(d, 0) > i:
                    arr[i], arr[last[d]] = arr[last[d]], arr[i]
                    return int(''.join(map(str, arr)))
