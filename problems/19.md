#### Idea
The challenge of this problem is to remove the node in one pass. A two-pass solution is trivial - we can get the size of the list in the first pass and count and remove the target node in the second pass. Using O(N) space is also trivial - we can store the indices of nodes in an array in one pass and remove the target directly using the auxiliary array. 

The trick to solve the problem using constant space in one pass is to use slow and fast pointers - the fast pointer is *n* nodes ahead the slow one, and we traverse the linked list using these two pointers simultaneously. Once the fast pointer reaching the end, the slow one stops at the target node, i.e., the *n*th node from the end of the list. To remove the target node, we also need to maintain the precursor of the slow pointer. There is a special case in which the head of the linked list needs to be removed. In this case, since the fast pointer starts earlier to keep the *n* distance from the slow one and already reaches the end before the slow one starts, the precursor of the slow pointer will be null and the algorithm should return the next node of the head.

#### Complexity
- Runtime: O(N)
- Space: O(1)
  
#### LC performance
- Runtime: 24 ms
- Memory usage: 13.2 MB

#### Code
```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.next = None

class Solution:
    def removeNthFromEnd(self, head: ListNode, n: int) -> ListNode:
        if not n or not head:
            return head
        # use a pair of slow and fast pointers to traverse the linked list 
        # simultaneously
        slow = fast = head
        # move the fast pointer first to let it ahead of the slow one by `n`
        while n:
            fast = fast.next
            n -= 1
        # use a precursor to track the node right before the one to be removed
        pre = None
        # traverse the linked list simultaneously using the slow and fast 
        # pointers. When the fast one reaches the end, the slow one is at the 
        # node to be removed
        while fast:
            pre = slow
            slow = slow.next
            fast = fast.next
        # remove the node by letting the precursor skip the node to be removed, 
        # but point to the one next to that node as the next. Note that it is 
        # possible that the precursor can be null when the first node of the 
        # list is to be removed. 
        if pre:
            pre.next = slow.next
        # if the first node is to be removed, return its next node as the head;
        # otherwise, just return the head
        return head if pre else head.next
