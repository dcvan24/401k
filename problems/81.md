#### Idea
The difference from [#33](33.md) is that there may be duplicates in the array.  The difference seems trivial but has a huge implication on the performance - the binary search solution for an rotated sorted array without duplicates is based on an assumption that **we can determine if the target exists in a sorted subarray by comparing it to the numbers at the boundaries**. However, with duplicates, there could be cases wherein we cannot tell where the target might be if **the numbers at the boundaries are identical**.  In this case, our "search pointer" gets totally lost and we need to help it "escape the woods". As a workaround, we need to shift the upper/lower bound **linearly** when the numbers at the boundaries are equal - if the upper bound is less than the target, we need to shift down the upper bound; if the lower bound is greater than the target, we need to shift up the lower bound. As a consequence, if there are a lot of duplicates, the runtime for the linear shift could dominate and the runtime complexity could be linear instead of logarithmic. 
 

#### Complexity
- Runtime: O(N)
- Space: O(1)
  
#### LC performance
- Runtime: 48 ms
- Memory usage: 13.1 MB

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def search(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> bool:
        lo, hi = 0, len(nums)
        while lo < hi:
            mid = (lo + hi)//2
            if nums[mid] == target:
                return True
            # if the right half is sorted, and the target happens to exist in 
            # this half
            if nums[mid] < target <= nums[hi - 1]:
                lo = mid + 1
            # otherwise, if the right half is sorted, i.e., the number at the 
            # left boundary is less than the right, the target must exist in the
            # left half
            elif nums[mid] < nums[hi - 1]:
                hi = mid
            # if the left half is sorted, and the target happens to exist in 
            # this half
            elif nums[lo] <= target < nums[mid]:
                hi = mid
            # otherwise, if the left half is sorted, the target must exist in 
            # the right half
            elif nums[lo] < nums[mid]:
                lo = mid + 1
            # if the numbers at the left and right boundaries are identical, 
            # the numbers in between are identical, and we cannot tell which 
            # side the target might be. So we shift the boundaries to help the 
            # `mid` to escape the subarray of duplicate numbers
            elif nums[mid] == nums[hi - 1]:
                hi -= 1
            elif nums[mid] == nums[lo]:
                lo += 1
        return False
