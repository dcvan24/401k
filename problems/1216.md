##### Top-down
```python
from functools import lru_cache 

class Solution:
    def isValidPalindrome(self, s: str, k: int) -> bool:
        """
        Just like #680 but with at most `k` deletions

        """
        
        @lru_cache(None)        
        def is_valid(l, r, k):
            # return true when the left and right meet
            if l >= r:
                return True
            # when the edit quota is used up but the left and right have yet to 
            # meet, it means the string cannot be transformed into a valid 
            # palindrome with `k` deletions
            if k < 0:
                return False
            # when the characters at the two ends matche
            if s[l] == s[r - 1]:
                # check if the substring without the two ends can be transformed 
                # into a valid palindrome with the given `k`
                return is_valid(l + 1, r - 1, k)
            # otherwise, we need to use the quota to delete the character at 
            # either end, and check if the rest can be a palindrome with the 
            # quota left
            k -= 1
            return is_valid(l + 1, r, k) or is_valid(l, r - 1, k) 
            
        return is_valid(0, len(s), k)
```

##### Bottom-up
```python
class Solution:
    def isValidPalindrome(self, s: str, k: int) -> bool:
        """
        At the core, the problem asks whether the string is within the given `k`
        edit distance to a valid palindrome. So we can assume `t` as the valid 
        palindrome we are looking for, which is a substring of `s`, and find the 
        edit distance between `s` and `t`. Finally, we need to check if `t` is 
        within the given `k` edit distance from the given `s`. 

        """
        n = len(s)
        # DP to keep track of edit distance between `s` and `t`
        dp = [[0] * (n + 1) for _ in range(n + 1)]
        for i in range(n + 1):
            for j in range(n + 1):
                # the distance from a string to an empty one is its full length
                if i == 0 or j == 0:
                    dp[i][j] = i or j
                # when the characters are the same at `s[i]` and `t[n - j - 1]`, 
                # no more edit is needed and the edit distance is the same 
                # between `s[:i]` and `t[:i]`
                elif s[i - 1] == s[n - j]:
                    dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1]
                # otherwise, we need to delete a character from either string, 
                # which increases the edit distance by 1
                else:
                    dp[i][j] = min(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i][j - 1]) + 1
        # Since we make edits to both strings `s` and `t` simultaneously, it is 
        # likely that duplicate edits are made on both strings and double the 
        # edit distance. Herein, we can get rid of the duplicate by halving the 
        # edit distance and check whether it is still less than or equal to the 
        # given `k`
        return dp[-1][-1] <= k*2
