        # frequent one. We can reorganize the string in multiple rounds with two 
        # characters addressed in each round. Used characters in each round are 
        # put into a wait queue, which will be put back to the heap at the end 
        # of each round, to avoid duplicate in each round.

                elif not waitq:
                    break
                i += 1
            # put everything in the wait queue back to the heap for the next 
            # round
