class Solution:
    def groupStrings(self, strings: List[str]) -> List[List[str]]:
        # to make it possible to shift from one string to another, the relative 
        # positions of characters between each other in ASCII code must be 
        # identical. Note: it is assumed that the letters are formed as a 
        # circular list, so `ba` has the same pattern as `az` since the distance 
        # between letters is same (25)
        sig = lambda s: tuple((ord(s[i + 1]) - ord(s[i]))%26 
                               for i in range(len(s) - 1))
        groups = defaultdict(list)
        for s in strings:
            groups[sig(s)].append(s)
