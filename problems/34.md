34 Find First and Last Position of Element in Sorted Array
=======================

#### Difficulty
<span style="color:#FABC60">Medium</span>

#### Keywords
- Binary search

#### Idea
The problem is an extension of the binary search problem, which asks for the boundaries of the target value in a sorted array. The idea can be summarized as follow:

1. To find the left boundary, we keep decreasing the upper bound when the current mid value is **greater than or equal to** the target 
2. To find the right boundary, we keep increasing the lower bound when the current mid value is **less than or equal to** the target

Different from the classic binary search, we do not stop the search when locating the target value. The boundary indices, if any, will be the **last lower bound**. To differentiate the cases that the target value is not found and that the boundaries are located, we need to additionally check if the lower bound value is valid. 

#### Complexity
- Runtime: O(logN)
- Space: O(1)

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def searchRange(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:
        lo, hi = 0, len(nums)
        res = [-1, -1]
        while lo < hi:
            mid = (lo + hi)//2
            if nums[mid] >= target:
                hi = mid 
            else:
                lo = mid + 1
                
        if lo == len(nums) or nums[lo] != target:
            return res

        res[0] = lo
        
        lo, hi = 0, len(nums)
        while lo < hi:
            mid = (lo + hi)//2
            if nums[mid] > target:
                hi = mid
            else:
                lo = mid + 1
        res[1] = lo - 1
                
        return res
