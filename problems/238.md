238 Product of Array Except Self
=======================
[Problem description](https://leetcode.com/problems/product-of-array-except-self/)

#### Difficulty
<span style="color:#FABC60">Medium</span>

#### Keywords
- Array
  
#### Idea
The problem requires no division, so the we need to calculate the product of elements on the both sides of every element instead. To do this in linear time, we need to **do the pre-calculation of element product for both sides and cache the results**. The follow-up requires no extra space and hints that the output array is not considered as extra, so we can use the output array to cache the *left product* for every element. Then we traverse the array in an opposite way, calculating and storing the *right product* in a single variable, and multiplying it with the left product in the output array. In this way, we use only O(N) time and O(1) space to calculate the product without division. 

#### Complexity
- Runtime: O(N)
- Space: O(1)
  
#### LC performance
- Runtime: 92 ms
- Memory usage: 20.7 MB

#### Code

```python
class Solution:
    def productExceptSelf(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        out, l, r = [], 1, 1
        for n in nums:
            out.append(l)
            l *= n
        for i in range(len(nums) - 1, -1, -1):
            out[i] *= r
            r *= nums[i]
        return out
```
