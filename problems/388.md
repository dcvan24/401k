#### Idea
The gotcha of the problem is that **only paths with a file name at end are considered for the length comparison, otherwise the length is considered as 0**. The problem also defines an entry as a file name **if it has at least one `.` character in it**. So we need to find the absolute paths of all valid files in the file system hierarchy. 

The entries are separated by newlines, i.e., `\n`. For each entry, the number of `\t` indicates its depth in the hierarchy. We can maintain an array that keeps track of parents of current entry during iteration. **Note that** if the depth of current entry is less than or equal to the number of parents, it means **we start traversing another directory at the current depth and the parents beyond the depth need to be discarded**. Finally, we maintain the global variable to track the max path length, and only do the compare-and-replace when encountering entries with `.` in it.

```python
class Solution:
    def lengthLongestPath(self, input: str) -> int:
        max_len = 0
        path = []
        for d in input.split('\n'):
            depth = d.count('\t')
            d = d[depth:]
            if depth < len(path):
                path = path[:depth]
            path.append(d)
            if '.' in d:
                max_len = max(max_len, len('/'.join(path)))
        return max_len
