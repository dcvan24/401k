class Solution:
    def toHex(self, num: int) -> str:
        # in case the given number is zero
        if not num:
            return str(num)
        res = ''
        # for a 32-bit number, the max length of its hexadecimal is at most 8. 
        # Note that do not use `num != 0` as the condition of the loop, since 
        # negative number will never be zero by being divided by 16
        for _  in range(8):
            # take the mod of the number over 16 and divide it by 16
            num, m = divmod(num, 16)
            # prepend the corresponding character of the mod to the result
            res = (str(m) if m < 10 else chr(ord('a') + m%10)) + res
            # stop when the number becomes zero
            if not num:
                break
        return res
