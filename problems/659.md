        counter = Counter(nums)

        # which is the key of the map
        chains = defaultdict(int)
        
        # traverse the array 
        for n in nums:

            # chains, skip it
            if counter[n] == 0:

            # if there is at least one chain ending before the current number, 
            # append the current number to the chain to make it longer
            if chains[n] > 0:
                chains[n] -= 1
                chains[n + 1] += 1
            # otherwise, try to form a new chain with existing numbers in the 
            # array
            elif counter[n + 1] > 0 and counter[n + 2] > 0:
                counter[n + 1] -= 1
                counter[n + 2] -= 1
                chains[n + 3] += 1
            # if neither are possible, the current number cannot be a part of 
            # any chain, so the given sequence cannot be splitted into 
            # consecutive subsequences as required. Hence, we return false
            else:
                return False
            # decrement the count of current number by one since one instance of
            # it has been added to a chain
            counter[n] -= 1
        
        # if every number in the given sequence can be assigned to a chain, then 
        # the it can be splitted as required
        return True
