3 Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters
=======================
[Problem description](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-substring-without-repeating-characters/)

#### Difficulty
<span style="color:#FABC60">Medium</span>

#### Keywords
- Sliding window
- Hash table

#### Idea
The key to this problem is to use a combination of **hash table** and **sliding window**. The hash table is used to store the position of where each character occurs. When traversing the string, we check if the current character recurs by look it up in the hash table - if it does, the substring spanning from its last occurrence to the current position does not contain any repeating character, and we compare-and-replace it with the maximum length so far; if not, we simply keep track of its occurrence by storing the position where it occurs. 


#### Complexity
- Runtime: O(N)
- Space: O(N)

#### LC performance
- Runtime: 60 ms
- Memory usage: 13.3 MB

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def lengthOfLongestSubstring(self, s: str) -> int:
        max_len, occur = 0, {}
        start = 0
        for i, c in enumerate(s):
            if c in occur and occur[c] >= start:
                max_len = max(max_len, i - start)
                start = occur[c] + 1
            occur[c] = i
        return max(max_len, len(s) - start)
