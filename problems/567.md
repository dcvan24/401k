567 Permutation in String
=======================
[Problem description](https://leetcode.com/problems/permutation-in-string/)

#### Difficulty
<span style="color:#FABC60">Medium</span>

#### Keywords
- Sliding window
  
#### Idea
The idea is to find the substring where all characters in `s1` appear in `s2` using a **sliding window**, and then check if the window size is equal to the size of `s1` - if so, it returns True immediately, indicating `s2` contains a permutation of `s1`; otherwise, it continue moving the sliding window to find the next qualified window. If the sliding window reaches the end of `s2`, it means there is no permutation of `s1` found in `s2`, therefore the function returns false. 

#### Complexity
- Runtime: O(N)
- Space: O(N)
  
#### LC performance
- Runtime: 120 ms
- Memory usage: 14 MB

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def checkInclusion(self, s1: str, s2: str) -> bool:
        from collections import Counter
        
        freq = Counter(s1)
        occurs, formed = {}, 0
        
        l = r = 0
        while r < len(s2):
            rc = s2[r]
            occurs[rc] = occurs.get(rc, 0) + 1
            if rc in freq and occurs[rc] == freq[rc]:
                formed += 1
            while formed == len(freq) and l <= r:
                lc = s2[l]
                occurs[lc] -= 1
                if lc in freq and occurs[lc] < freq[lc]:
                    formed -= 1
                    if formed < len(freq):
                        occurs[lc] += 1
                        formed += 1
                        break
                l += 1
            
            if formed == len(freq) and r - l + 1 == len(s1):
                return True
            r += 1
        
        return False
