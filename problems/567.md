567 Permutation in String
=======================
[Problem description](https://leetcode.com/problems/permutation-in-string/)

#### Difficulty
<span style="color:#FABC60">Medium</span>

#### Keywords
- [Sliding window](../categories/sliding_window.md)
  
#### Idea
The idea is to find the substring where all characters in `s1` appear in `s2` using a **sliding window**, and then check if the window size is equal to the size of `s1` - if so, it returns True immediately, indicating `s2` contains a permutation of `s1`; otherwise, it continue moving the sliding window to find the next qualified window. If the sliding window reaches the end of `s2`, it means there is no permutation of `s1` found in `s2`, therefore the function returns false. 

#### Complexity
- Runtime: O(N)
- Space: O(N)
  
#### LC performance
- Runtime: 108 ms
- Memory usage: 13.8 MB

#### Code
```python
from collections import Counter
