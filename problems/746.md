746 Min Cost Climbing Stairs
=======================
[Problem description](https://leetcode.com/problems/min-cost-climbing-stairs/)

#### Difficulty
<span style="color:green">Easy</span>

#### Keywords
- Dynamic programming

#### Idea
This is a classic dynamic programming problem. We use an additional array to keep track of the minimum cost to step to every staircase. At every step, we compare the total cost for different stepping options and select the one resulting the least cost. The total cost after the last step is the minimum cost for climbing the whole stairs. 


#### Complexity
- Runtime: O(N)
- Space: O(N)

#### LC performance
- Runtime: 44 ms
- Memory usage: 13.2 MB

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def minCostClimbingStairs(self, cost: List[int]) -> int:
        if len(cost) < 3:
            return min(cost)
        total = [0] * (len(cost) + 1)
        for i in range(2, len(cost) + 1):
            total[i] = min(total[i - 1] + cost[i - 1], total[i - 2] + cost[i - 2])
        return total[-1]
