##### Quicksort
```python
import random 

class Solution:
    def kClosest(self, points: List[List[int]], K: int) -> List[List[int]]:
        # calculates the distance to (0, 0) for every point
        points = [(p[0]**2 + p[1]**2, p) for p in points]
        
        def quickselect(start, end):
            if start >= end:
                return
            # choose the pivot randomly
            pivot = random.randint(start, end)
            # swap the pivot and the first element in the array to secure the 
            # pivot
            points[start], points[pivot] = points[pivot], points[start]
            # `i` and `j` are the tail of the partitions with elements less and 
            # greater than the pivot
            # `i` starts from the next position of the pivot to the right
            # `j` starts from the end of subarray to the left
            i, j = start + 1, end
            # before they meet
            while i <= j:
                # if arr[i] <= pivot, move on `i`
                while i <= j and points[i][0] <= points[start][0]:
                    i += 1
                # if arr[j] >= pivot, move on `j`
                while i <= j and points[j][0] >= points[start][0]:
                    j -= 1
                # if `i` and `j` have yet to meet, that means 
                # arr[i] > pivot and arr[j] < pivot. So we swap them to ensure 
                # we partition the array by the pivot
                if i < j: 
                    points[i], points[j] = points[j], points[i]
            # `i` and `j` have met, and `j` is sitting at the position where 
            # the pivot should be, so swap the elements at `start` and `j` to 
            # place the pivot into the right position
            points[start], points[j] = points[j], points[start]
            
            # if `j` sits on the K-th position, that means there are K elements 
            # on its left including itself, which are the K closest points we 
            # are looking for, so we end up here
            if j == K:
                return
            # if `j` sits at the right to the K-th position, we get too many on 
            # the left side, so we truncate the array on the right side to 
            # move `j` to the left
            if j > K:
                quickselect(start, j - 1)
            # if `j` sits at the left to the K-th position, we get too few on 
            # the left, so we truncate the array on the left side to move `j`
            # to the right
            else:
                quickselect(j + 1, end)
        
        quickselect(0, len(points) - 1)
        return [p for _, p in points[:K]]
```

##### Heap
```python
from heapq import heappush, heappop

class Solution:
    def kClosest(self, points: List[List[int]], K: int) -> List[List[int]]:
        dist = lambda x: x[0]**2 + x[1]**2
        heap = []
        for coord in points:
            heappush(heap, (-dist(coord), coord))
            if len(heap) > K:
                heappop(heap)
        return [coord for _, coord in heap]
```
