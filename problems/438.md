438 Find All Anagrams in a String
=======================
[Problem description](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-all-anagrams-in-a-string/)

#### Difficulty
<span style="color:#FABC60">Medium</span>

#### Keywords
- [Anagram](../categories/anagram.md)
- [Sliding window](../categories/sliding_window.md)

#### Idea
I think this is where I failed when interviewing for the internship with Facebook... 

#### Complexity
- Runtime: O(S) where S is the length of *s*
- Space: O(P) where P is the length of *p*

#### LC performance
- Runtime: 144 ms
- Memory usage: 5.19 MB

#### Code
##### Python
```python
from collections import Counter

class Solution:
    def findAnagrams(self, s: str, p: str) -> List[int]:
        # count the occurrences of characters in `p`
        count = Counter(p)
        length = len(p)
        
        res = []
        l = r = 0        
        while r < len(s):
            # if the current window size is smaller than the length of `p`, 
            # keep moving the right boundary of the window
            if r - l < len(p):
                # if the current character in `s` also appears in `p`
                if s[r] in count:
                    # decrement the occurrences of the character in `p`
                    count[s[r]] -= 1
                    # there can be more occurrences of a character in `s` than 
                    # in `p`, so we only consider a character as a part of a 
                    # possible anagram when its occurrences in `p` is greater 
                    # than 0
                    if count[s[r]] >= 0:
                        length -= 1
                r += 1
            
            # if all the characters in `p` are found, it indicates an anagram 
            # of `p` is found, and the starting point is the left boundary. 
            if length == 0:
                res.append(l)
            
            # if the window size is greater than or equal to the length of `p`, 
            # no matter if an anagram of `p` is found or not, the left boundary 
            # of the window needs to be moved forward
            if r - l >= len(p):
                # recover the occurrences of characters appearing in both `s` 
                # and `p`
                if s[l] in count:
                    count[s[l]] += 1
                    # as explained above, as `s` may have excessive occurrences 
                    # of a character that also shown in `p`, we only consider a 
                    # character as the member of an anagram when its occurrences
                    # is recovered to over 0
                    if count[s[l]] > 0:
                        length += 1
                l += 1
        
        return res
