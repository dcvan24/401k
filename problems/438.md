=======================
[Problem description](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-all-anagrams-in-a-string/)

#### Difficulty
<span style="color:green">Easy</span>

#### Keywords
- Sliding window

#### Idea
I think this is where I failed when interviewing for the internship with Facebook... 

#### Complexity
- Runtime: O(S) where S is the length of *s*
- Space: O(P) where P is the length of *p*

#### LC performance
- Runtime: 144 ms
- Memory usage: 5.19 MB

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def findAnagrams(self, s: str, p: str) -> List[int]:
        from collections import defaultdict 
        
        need, occur = defaultdict(int), defaultdict(int)
        for c in p:
            need[c] += 1
            
        i, res = 0, []
        left, started = 0, False
        while i < len(s) and len(p) + left <= len(s):
            c = s[i]
            if c in need:
                if not started:
                    left = i
                    started = True
                need[c] -= 1
                occur[c] += 1
                if need[c] == 0:
                    del need[c]
                if len(need) == 0:
                    res += left,
            elif c in occur:
                while c not in need:
                    l = s[left]
                    need[l] += 1
                    occur[l] -= 1
                    if occur[l] == 0:
                        del occur[l]
                    left += 1
                i -= 1
            else:
                started = False
                while occur:
                    k, v = occur.popitem()
                    need[k] += 1
            i += 1
        return res
