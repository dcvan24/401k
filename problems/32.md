##### DP
```python
class Solution:
    def longestValidParentheses(self, s: str) -> int:
        # keep track of the global maximum length
        maxlen = 0
        # DP that keeps track of the longest parentheses sequence ending at each 
        # index 
        dp = [0] * len(s)
        
        for i in range(1, len(s)):
            # when the current parenthesis is a right one
            if s[i] == ')':
                # if the last one is a left one, they make a valid pair and 
                # extend the length of current sequence by 2
                if s[i - 1] == '(':
                    # they extends the length of the sequence ending at `i - 2` 
                    # by 2
                    dp[i] = dp[max(i - 2, 0)] + 2
                # if the last one is a right one, there are two consecutive 
                # right parentheses. So the only chance to extend the current 
                # sequence is that there are nested parentheses, so that current 
                # right parenthesis can be matched by the dangling left 
                # parenthesis before the current sequence. Herein, we check if 
                # the parenthesis right before the current sequence is a left 
                # one, which can match the current right parenthesis and make 
                # a valid pair. 
                #
                # meanwhile, by matching the dangling left parenthesis, we may 
                # possibly connect two valid sequences, which were separated by 
                # the dangling parenthesis before. With it matched, the two 
                # valid sequences are connected to form a longer sequence
                elif i > dp[i - 1] and s[i - dp[i - 1] - 1] == '(':
                    dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + dp[max(i - dp[i - 1] - 2, 0)] + 2
                # update the global maximum length 
                maxlen = max(maxlen, dp[i])
            
        return maxlen
```

##### Counting
```python
class Solution:
    def longestValidParentheses(self, s: str) -> int:
        # counter of left and right parentheses
        l = r = 0
        # global max length
        maxlen = 0
        # traverse from left to right
        for c in s:
            # increment the number of left parentheses 
            if c == '(':
                l += 1
            # increment the number of right parentheses
            else:
                r += 1
            # when the number of two parentheses balances, compare the sequence 
            # length to the maximum and replace the maximum if it is longer
            if l == r:
                maxlen = max(maxlen, l + r)
            # when there are more right parentheses, reset the counters to zero 
            # and restart the counting
            elif r > l:
                l = r = 0
        
        l = r = 0
        # traverse from right to left
        for i in range(len(s) - 1, -1, -1):
            if s[i] == '(':
                l += 1
            else:
                r += 1
            if l == r:
                maxlen = max(maxlen, l + r)
            # when there are more left parentheses, reset the counters to zero 
            # and restart the counting
            elif l > r:
                l = r = 0
        return maxlen
```
