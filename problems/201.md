#### Idea
Recall the behavior of AND operation, the bit is set only if **this bit is set for all the numbers involved in the computation**. The straightforward solution is to perform AND operation among numbers in the given range, which takes O(N) time and therefore inefficient. Given the numbers considered in this problem are 32-bit, alternatively, we can find the result bitwise in O(1) time, more precisely at most 32 iterations. 

If thinking of only the numbers at the boundary, the result will have the bits set which are also set for the numbers. For instance, given the range `[5, 7]` which is represented as `[101, 111]` in binary, we can have `101` as the start point. Then considering other numbers in the range, we can find that some lower bit(s) set in the intermediate result may not be set in these numbers. For instance, 6 is represented as `110` in binary, wherein the last bit is not set but set in the start point. Hence, the problem is equivalent to **finding the contiguously set bits at the high end for m&n given the range [m, n]**. For instance, in the given example, the result is `100` since only the highest bit is contiguously set for `5&7 (101)`. Given another example of `[13, 15]` (`[1101, 1111]`), `13&15 = 1101`, therefore the result is the `1100` since only the highest two bits are set in `13&15`.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def rangeBitwiseAnd(self, m: int, n: int) -> int:
        if m == 0 or n == 0:
            return 0
        if m == n:
            return m
        b = 1
        while b * 2 <= m:
            b <<= 1
        res = 0
        while b > 0:
            if m//b == n//b and (m//b)%2 == 1:
                res += b
            b >>= 1
        return res
