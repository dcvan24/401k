#### Idea
We use two arrays to keep track of the max length to any given index *i* and their corresponding count. Initially, if the given array is not empty, the longest subsequence contains a single number at every index and their corresponding count is 1. Then we look for longer subsequence ending at every index in the given array. The way to find the longest subsequence is identical to [#300](300.md) - we increment the length of the longest subsequence ending at *j* by 1 if observing the number at *i* is greater than that at *j* when `i > j`, in which case, adding `nums[i]` prolongs the longest subsequence. Hence, when the length extension of the longest subsequence occurs, the number of longest subsequences remains unchanged - no matter how many subsequences exist before, now they all end with `nums[i]`, therefore the current number of longest subsequences is unchanged. In another case, if the extension doesn't occur but the maximum length so far to *j* differs from the that at *i* by 1, we need to add the count at *j* to that at *i*, since these subsequences will eventually be the longest ones by including `nums[i]` at the end, and they are all the possible variations.

```python
class Solution:
    def findNumberOfLIS(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        if not nums:
            return 0
        n = len(nums)
        lengths = [0] * n
        count = [1] * n
        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(i):
                if nums[i] <= nums[j]:
                    continue
                if lengths[j] >= lengths[i]:
                    lengths[i] = lengths[j] + 1
                    count[i] = count[j]
                elif lengths[j] + 1 == lengths[i]:
                    count[i] += count[j]
        longest = max(lengths)
        return sum(c for i, c in enumerate(count) if lengths[i] == longest)
