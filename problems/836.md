#### Idea
Instead of enumerating the cases that the rectangles are overlapped, the cases in which they are not overlapped are more straightforward - the rectangles can never overlap if **the top left of a rectangle is away from the bottom left of the other**. This condition can be easily described in axis, and the opposite of it indicates overlapping. 

#### Complexity
- Runtime: O(1)

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def isRectangleOverlap(self, rec1: List[int], rec2: List[int]) -> bool:
        return not (rec1[2] <= rec2[0] or
                    rec1[3] <= rec2[1] or 
                    rec1[0] >= rec2[2] or
                    rec1[1] >= rec2[3])
```
