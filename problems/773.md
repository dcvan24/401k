773 Sliding Puzzle
=======================
[Problem description](https://leetcode.com/problems/sliding-puzzle/)

#### Difficulty
<span style="color:red">Hard</span>

#### Keywords
- Breadth-first search
- Backtracking
  
#### Idea
The given matrix can be represented in a compact fashion using tuple. The benefits of using tuple are the following:

1. It is immutable and thus hashable
2. It is easy to be converted to a list for swapping without type conversions as proposed in some solutions
3. It shares most features owned by sequence data structures

The gotcha is that the row boundaries need to be handled carefully - you may not swap the values at the boundaries since they may not be adjacent (e.g., end of a row and start of the next row).  

The rest are basic BFS + backtracking. The algorithm enumerates all possible moves and returns -1 if none of them match the target.

class Solution:
    def slidingPuzzle(self, board: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        from collections import deque
        
        target = tuple(list(range(1, 6)) + [0])
        visited = set()
        
        state = tuple([n for r in board for n in r])
        
        q = deque([(state, 0)])                    
        while q:
            cur, n = q.popleft()
            if cur == target:
                return n
            visited.add(cur)
            n += 1
            idx = cur.index(0)
            for mv in (1, -1, 3, -3):
                if idx + mv < 0 or idx + mv > 5:
                    continue
                # handle row boundaries
                if (idx%3 == 0 and mv == -1) or ((idx + 1)%3 == 0 and mv == 1):
                    continue
                c = list(cur)
                c[idx], c[idx + mv] = c[idx + mv], c[idx]
                c = tuple(c)
                if c in visited:
                    continue
                q += (c, n),
        
        return -1
