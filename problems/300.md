#### Keywords
- Dynamic programming

#### Idea
The main idea is to **find the longest preceding subsequence during the traversal**. Specifically, denoting the ending index of a subsequence by *j*, we can get the length of the subsequence as *dp[j]*. Obviously, we do not consider the length of every possible subsequence. Instead, we only consider those whose ending number is smaller than the one currently being traversed, i.e., `nums[j] < nums[i]` if denoting *i* as the number being currently traversed. Among these candidates subsequences, we look for the largest length, if any, denoted by `max_len`. If there is no candidate, then `max_len = 0`. After finding the largest length, we increment the length by 1 since every number is a subsequence by itself with the length of 1. Finally, at the end of each step, we compare-and-replace the global largest length.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def lengthOfLIS(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        if not nums:
            return 0
        
        res = 0
        dp = [0] * len(nums)
        dp[0] = 1
        
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            max_len = max([dp[j] for j in range(i) if nums[i] > nums[j]], default=0)
            dp[i] = max_len + 1
            res = max(res, dp[i])
        return res
