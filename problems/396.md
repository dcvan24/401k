#### Idea
The crux is to recognize the pattern that **the multipliers for all but the next value to rotate in the array increment by 1 at every rotation, except for the F(0)**. For example, given `A = [4, 3, 2, 6]`, `F(0)` is the starting point and we can compare `F(0)`, `F(1)` and `F(2)` to find the pattern.

```
F(0) = 0 * 4 + 1 * 3 + 2 * 2 + 3 * 6
F(1) = 0 * 6 + 1 * 4 + 2 * 3 + 3 * 2
F(2) = 0 * 2 + 1 * 6 + 2 * 4 + 3 * 3
```

We can clearly see that `F(1) = F(0) + [array sum] - [array length] * [next value to rotate]`, specifically, `F(1) = F(0) + 15 - 4 * 6`. Same pattern can be applied to `F(1) -> F(2)`. Therefore, we need to calculate the base `F(0)` and array sum as the initial point and keeps track of the value to rotate at each rotation. During the iteration, we just need to apply the formula above and compare-and-replace the max sum in order to find the final result.

#### Code

```python
class Solution:
    def maxRotateFunction(self, A: List[int]) -> int:
        max_v = cur = sum(i * n for i, n in enumerate(A))
        s = sum(A)
        for i in range(len(A)):
            next_tail = A[-(i + 1)]
            cur += s - len(A) * next_tail
            max_v = max(max_v, cur)
        return max_v
```
