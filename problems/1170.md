#### Idea

#### Complexity
- Runtime: O(max(M,N)logN) where M and N are the number of queries and words, respectively
- Space: O(N)
  
#### LC performance
- Runtime: 80 ms
- Memory usage: 14.2 MB

#### Code
```python
import bisect as bi 

class Solution:
    def numSmallerByFrequency(self, queries: List[str], words: List[str]) -> List[int]:
        # function to compute the smallest frequency for a given word
        get_smallest_freq = lambda w: w.count(min(w))
        
        freq = []
        # compute the smallest frequency for every given word and keep the 
        # frequency in a sorted list
        for w in words:
            count = get_smallest_freq(w)
            freq.insert(bi.bisect(freq, count), count)
        
        res = []
        for q in queries:
            # compute the smallest frequency for each query
            count = get_smallest_freq(q)
            # find the number of words with smaller or equal frequency
            idx = bi.bisect_right(freq, count)
            # the rest are the words with greater frequency
            res.append(len(freq) - idx)
        
        return res
