130 Surrounded Regions
=======================

#### Difficulty
<span style="color:#FABC60">Medium</span>

#### Keywords
- Depth-first search
- Backtracking
- Union-find

#### Idea
This problem is similar to [#200](200.md) wherein we need to find the connected areas and perform certain subsequent operations upon them. In this problem, we are asked to flip the cells marked as `O` in the region surrounded by `X`. The exits must exist on the boundaries of the given matrix, and cells with a path to any exit can keep themselves from being flipped. 

At the first glance, this problem can be definitely solved using DFS + backtracking. The other intuitive solution is to use **union-find**, by which we can find the ancestors of every cell marked as `O` and check if they are the exits. We only flip those whose ancestors are not exits. However, this solution only beats ~5% of submissions on LC, maybe due to the overhead for constructing the data structure. 


#### Complexity
- Runtime: O(MNO($\alpha$(MN)))
- Space: O(MN)
  
#### LC performance
- Runtime: 372 ms
