#### Idea
The key to this problem is to **use a monotonic decreasing queue to keep track of the maximum onwards as the sliding window moving forward**. A little bit rationale behind using a monotonic decreasing queue - **we only cares about the numbers on the right side of the current maximum number**. If `b` occurs in prior to `a` and `a` is the current maximum, `b` has no chance to be the maximum in the future as the window slides, thus discarding it from the queue when encountering `a` will not affect the algorithm at all. Specifically, we add every number to the queue as the right bound of the window stretching. When the window size reaching the given limit, we start closing the left bound to slide the window. When closing the left bound, we check if the number on the left bound is the current maximum, i.e., the very left of the queue. If it is, we pop it off the queue and the next number in the queue will be the maximum for the next window, since the queue is monotonically decreasing from left to right. Herein, we can get the sliding window maximum in one pass.

        res = []
        
        if not nums:
            return res
        
        l = r = 0
        stack = []
        
        while r < len(nums):
            while stack and stack[-1] < nums[r]:
                stack.pop()
            stack += nums[r],
            while r - l + 1 > k:
                if stack[0] == nums[l]:
                    stack.pop(0)
                l += 1
            if r + 1 > k - 1:
                res += stack[0],
            r += 1
        
        return res
