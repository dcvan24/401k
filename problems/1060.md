class Solution:
    def missingElement(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        # calculate the number of missing numbers by the given index
        missing = lambda idx: nums[idx] - nums[0] - idx
        n = len(nums)
        
        # if the given `k` is greater than the number of missing numbers on the 
        # left of the last number in the given array, the k-th missing number is 
        # on the right of the last number
        if k > missing(n - 1):
            return nums[-1] + k - missing(n - 1)
        
        # otherwise, the k-th missing number is between a pair of numbers in the
        # given array. So we use binary search to find it
        lo, hi = 0, n
        while lo < hi:
            # find the index in the mid
            mid = (lo + hi)//2
            # if the number of missing numbers on its left is smaller than `k`,
            # move the lower bound to the mid to find more missing numbers
            if missing(mid) < k:
                lo = mid + 1
            # otherwise, move the upper bound to the mid to reduce the number of 
            # missing numbers
            else:
                hi = mid
        # the search ends at the right side of the k-th missing number
        return nums[lo - 1] + k - missing(lo - 1)
