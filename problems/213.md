213 House Robber II
=======================
[Problem description](https://leetcode.com/problems/house-robber-ii/)

#### Difficulty
<span style="color:#FABC60">Medium</span>

#### Keywords
- Dynamic programming

#### Idea
The difference from [#198](198.md) is that the houses are arranged in a circle, therefore the first and last houses are adjacent to each other. Hence, we must choose **either but not both houses**. As a solution, we take both paths for comparison and choose the more profitable one. In implementation, to consider the first house, we exclude the last house, and *vice versa*. 

#### Complexity
- Runtime: O(N)
- Space: O(1)

#### LC performance
- Runtime: 36 ms
- Memory usage: 13.9 MB

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def rob(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        if len(nums) < 2:
            return sum(nums)
        pre, cur = 0, 0
        for i, n in enumerate(nums[:-1]):
            tmp = cur
            cur = max(pre + n, cur)
            pre = tmp
        res1 = cur
        
        pre, cur = 0, 0
        for i, n in enumerate(nums[1:]):
            tmp = cur
            cur = max(pre + n, cur)
            pre = tmp
        
        return max(res1, cur)
