#### Idea
This is a one-way BFS solution with backtracking, which backtracks the path from the beginning word to the end. Since the problem asks for the shortest transformations, the algorithm should stop early before proceeding to the next level once a qualified path is found.  

Another challenge is that certain word could be shared among multiple qualified paths, and tracking if the word is already visited is not sufficient, since it may be repeatedly used at the same level. As a solution, instead of the binary state, we track at which level the visit occurs, and we only consider the path if the same word is visited again at the same level. The rationale is that if the word is visited again in the next level, the subsequent transformation, if any, will be identical with the shorter paths in which the word is visited earlier in the previous levels, therefore the path cannot be the shortest path.

        q, visited = deque([([beginWord], 1)]), {beginWord: 1}
        
        min_dist = len(wordList)
        
        while q: 
            path, dist = q.popleft()
            if path[-1] == endWord and dist <= min_dist:
                min_dist = min(min_dist, dist)
                res += path,
                continue
            if dist == min_dist:
                continue
            last = path[-1]
            for i in range(len(last)):
                for c in chars[i]:
                    w = last[:i] + c + last[i + 1:]
                    if w not in words:
                        continue
                    if w in visited and visited[w] <= dist:
                        continue
                    visited[w] = dist + 1
                    q += (path + [w], dist + 1),
        return res
