#### Idea
The challenge of this problem is how to handle multiplications and divisions, since they take the precedence over additions and subtractions. The solution is similar to [#282](282.md), in which we keep track of both previous and current operands to handle the precedence. For example, given an expression `4 + 2 * 2 * 2`, we first process `4 + 2` since we evaluate the expression from left to right. In this case, we evaluate the expression to get the result `res = 6` and note `2` as the previous operand for the next operation, i.e., `pre = 2`. Moving to `4 + 2 * 2`, we realize that the multiplication should occur in prior to the addition, therefore we need to reverse the previous operation, i.e. subtract the previous operand from the current result. So we do `res - pre + pre * 2 = 6 - 2 + 2 * 2 = 4 + 2 * 2`, and get `res = 8` and `pre = 2 * 2 = 4`. Lastly, we proceed to `4 + 2 * 2 * 2`, and similarly, we handle the multiplication as done in the last step. The way to handle division is identical with the multiplication, and in this way we can get the correct result. 

One thing to note is that **we need to keep track of the opposite of a number if the previous operation is subtraction**. For example, given `4 - 2 * 2`, when evaluating `4 - 2`, we need to note `pre = -2` rather than `2`, since what we really want is `2 + 2 - 2 * 2 = 4 - 2 * 2` when moving to the next operation. This is consistent with the solution in [#282](282.md).

Lastly, a pitfall in Python is that the floor division (`//`) will return the wrong result if the result is negative, since it always takes the next smaller integer of the float-point result, but the problem expects us to simply remove the decimal. For instance, `-3//2 = -2` since the float-point result is `-1.5` and the floor division takes the next smaller integer, which is `-2`. However, the problem expects `-1` by simply wiping out the decimals. Hence, to evaluate the division, we should do `int(a/b)` instead of `a//b`.

```python
class Solution:
    def calculate(self, s: str) -> int:
        res = 0
        # default the first operation to addition, since the first number is 
        # in effect added to the final result, although it is usually not 
        # prefixed by a '+' sign.
        prev, cur, op = 0, 0, '+'
        # add a dummy operator to the end of the equation to signal the end of 
        # the last number and force the last operation
        s += '+'
        for c in s:
            # skip empty space
            if c == ' ':
                continue
            if c in ('+', '-', '*', '/'):
                # an operator is the sign of the end of the previous number. 
                # At this point we have the operator and number for the previous 
                # operation, so we perform the previous operation, and update  
                # the operator with the current one
                if op == '+':
                    res += cur
                    prev = cur
                elif op == '-':
                    res -= cur
                    prev = -cur
                # multiplication/division has precedence over 
                # additions/subtractions, so we keep track of the previous 
                # number in case we need to reverse the previous operation if 
                # the precedence needs to be forced. 
                elif op == '*':
                    res = res - prev + prev * cur
                    prev = prev * cur
                else:
                    res = res - prev + int(prev/cur)
                    prev = int(prev/cur)
                op, cur = c, 0
            else:
                # otherwise we increment the current number digit by digit
                cur = cur * 10 + int(c)
        
        return res
