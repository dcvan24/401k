140 Word Break II
=======================
[Problem description](https://leetcode.com/problems/word-break-ii/)

#### Difficulty
<span style="color:red">Hard</span>

#### Keywords
- Dynamic programming
- Breadth-first search
  
#### Idea
This problem stems from [#139](139.md), in which the only difference is that we need to track all the word breaking solutions. Hence, we need to backtrack all the valid paths from the start to the end. In implementation, instead of tracking whether there exists a valid path till each index, we keep track of the predecessors. We use the similar DP to construct the graph with all the valid paths. If such graph exists, we trace back using BFS (or DFS) to construct the strings after breaking, and finally return them. Otherwise, we return an empty list, which means there does not exist a valid word breaking solution with the given string and dictionary. 

#### Complexity
- Runtime: O($N^2$)
- Space: O(N)
  
#### LC performance
- Runtime: 44 ms
- Memory usage: 13.2 MB

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def wordBreak(self, s: str, wordDict: List[str]) -> List[str]:
        res = []
        if not s or not wordDict:
            return res
        
        words = set(wordDict)
        
        dp = [None] * len(s)
        
        for i in range(len(s)):
            for j in range(i, len(s)):
                if i > 0 and dp[i - 1] is None:
                    break
                w = s[i: j + 1]
                if w in words:
                    if dp[j]:
                        dp[j] += i - 1,
                    else:
                        dp[j] = [i - 1]
        
        if not dp[-1]:
            return res
        
        from collections import deque
        
        q = deque([(pre, len(s), []) for pre in dp[-1]])
        while q:
            pre, cur, sen = q.popleft()
            sen += s[pre + 1: cur],
            if pre == -1:
                res += ' '.join(reversed(sen)),
                continue
            for i in dp[pre]:
                q += (i, pre + 1, list(sen)),
        
        return res
