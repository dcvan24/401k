```python
class Solution:
    def canPartition(self, nums: List[int]) -> bool:
        if len(nums) < 2:
            return False
        target, rem = divmod(sum(nums), 2)
        if rem > 0:
            return False
        nums.sort(reverse=True)
        if nums[0] > target:
            return False
        
        def partition(pars):
            if not nums:
                return True
            v = nums.pop()
            for i, n in enumerate(pars):
                if n + v <= target:
                    pars[i] += v
                    if partition(pars):
                        return True
                    pars[i] -= v
                if n == 0:
                    break
            nums.append(v)
            return False

        return partition([0, 0])

##### DP
```python
class Solution:
    def canPartition(self, nums: List[int]) -> bool:  
        ssum, rem = divmod(sum(nums), 2)
        # the array can only be partitioned if there is no remainder after the 
        # partitioning
        if rem != 0:
            return False
        
        # use DP to keep track of whether the target sum can be achieved with 
        # the first `i` numbers
        dp = [[False] * (ssum + 1) for _ in range(len(nums))]
        
        # when the target sum is 0, we can definitely achieve the target at any 
        # index by not picking any number
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            dp[i][0] = True
        
        # when we are at the first number and the target sum is greater than 0,
        # the only option we have is to check if the current number is equal to 
        # the target sum. 
        for s in range(1, ssum + 1):
            dp[0][s] = nums[0] == s
        
        # otherwise, we need to either include or exclude the current number 
        # into one partition
        # 
        # if including the current number, we need to make sure the number is 
        # smaller than or equal to the target sum, otherwise the number cannot 
        # be included anyway. Furthermore, we need to check if we can use the 
        # rest of the first `i - 1` numbers to make `target_sum - nums[i]`, 
        # since we can achieve the target sum by including the current number 
        # only if adding up to the sum made by the some of previous `i - 1` 
        # numbers makes the target sum.
        # 
        # if excluding the current number, we simply check if the target sum can 
        # be achieved with some numbers in the first `i - 1` numbers. 
        for i in range(1, len(nums)):
            for s in range(1, ssum + 1):
                dp[i][s] = dp[i - 1][s] or (s >= nums[i] and dp[i - 1][s - nums[i]])
        
        return dp[-1][-1]
