#### Difficulty

#### Keywords
- Pre-order tree traversal
- Array 
- String
  
#### Idea
The core of the problem is simply to recover a binary tree from its pre-order representation. The pitfall is on the processing of the string representation. Specifically, the value of each tree node can be an integer >10, which means it is represented as a string with length greater than 1. Hence, the algorithm should be able to detect the end of a node value string and then start parsing. Apparently, the node value string ends when **the depth symbol `-` occurs** or **the tree representation ends**. For the former case, we need to additionally check the precursing character to determine whether the occurrence of the depth symbol signals the end of a node value or just increment of depth (when the precursing character is also `-`). 

Besides, we only need a map to keep track of the **most recently created node** at each level, and mount each new node to its parent properly. We should return the node with depth 0, which is the root of the tree by definition. 

#### Complexity
- Runtime: O(N) 
- Space: O(logN)
  
#### LC performance
- Runtime: 72 ms
- Memory usage: 13.2 MB

#### Code
```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.left = None
#         self.right = None

class Solution:
    def recoverFromPreorder(self, S: str) -> TreeNode:
        root = None
        if not str:
            return root
        
        levels, d = {}, 0
        cur = ''
        # add an artificial parsing signal to force
        # parsing of the last node.
        S = '%s-'%S
        for i, c in enumerate(S):
            if c != '-':
                cur = '%s%s'%(cur, c)
                continue
            if S[i - 1] == '-':
                d += 1
                continue
            n = int(cur)
            levels[d] = TreeNode(int(n))
            if d > 0:
                p = levels[d - 1]
                if p.left:
                    p.right = levels[d]
                else:
                    p.left = levels[d]
            cur = ''
            d = 1
        return levels[0]
