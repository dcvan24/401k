#### Difficulty

#### Keywords
- [Binary search tree](../categories/bst.md)
  
#### Idea
Recall the definition of a binary search tree, **the value of a node must be greater than any node in its left subtree, and less than any one in its right subtree**. Herein, only checking the immediate children of each node is insufficient to determine if the given tree is a valid BST, since it is possible that, e.g., the value of the right child is greater than the node's value, but also greater than the value of the node's parent, to which the node is its left child - the tree is not a valid BST in this case, but simply checking the immediate children will determine it as a valid BST. 

Instead, we should recursively check **the lower and upper bounds** for each node, since the value of a node in a valid BST should be bounded by its ancestors. 

#### Complexity
- Runtime: O(N)
- Space: O(N)
  
#### LC performance
- Runtime: 56 ms
- Memory usage: 16.4 MB

#### Code
```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.left = None
#         self.right = None

class Solution:
    """
    By definition, a node in BST must be greater than any node in its left 
    subtree and smaller than any node in its right subtree. So the lower and 
    upper bounds need to be kept to check if a node falls in the range. 
    
    """
    def isValidBST(self, root: TreeNode) -> bool:
        
        def recurse(n, lower, upper):
            # an empty tree is a valid BST
            if not n:
                return True
            # if the node's value falls out of the given range, the tree is not 
            # a valid BST
            if n.val <= lower or n.val >= upper:
                return False
            # check the left and right subtrees recursively
            # the node's value becomes the upper bound of the left subtree and 
            # the lower bound of the right one
            return recurse(n.left, lower, n.val) and recurse(n.right, n.val, upper)
        
        # initially, there are no upper and lower bounds, so they are set 
        # positive and negative infinite, respectively. 
        return recurse(root, float('-inf'), float('inf'))
