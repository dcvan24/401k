#### Keywords
- Binary search tree
  
#### Idea
Recall the definition of a binary search tree, **the value of a node must be greater than any node in its left subtree, and less than any one in its right subtree**. Herein, only checking the immediate children of each node is insufficient to determine if the given tree is a valid BST, since it is possible that, e.g., the value of the right child is greater than the node's value, but also greater than the value of the node's parent, to which the node is its left child - the tree is not a valid BST in this case, but simply checking the immediate children will determine it as a valid BST. 

Instead, we should recursively check **the lower and upper bounds** for each node, since the value of a node in a valid BST should be bounded by its ancestors. 

#### Complexity
- Runtime: O(N)
- Space: O(N)
  
#### LC performance
- Runtime: 56 ms
- Memory usage: 16.4 MB

#### Code
```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.left = None
#         self.right = None

class Solution:
    def isValidBST(self, root: TreeNode) -> bool:
        
        def recurse(n, lower=float('-inf'), upper=float('inf')):
            if not n:
                return True
            if n.val <= lower or n.val >= upper:
                return False
            return recurse(n.left, lower, n.val) and recurse(n.right, n.val, upper)
        
        return recurse(root)
