39 Combination Sum
=======================
[Problem description](https://leetcode.com/problems/combination-sum/)

#### Difficulty
<span style="color:#FABC60">Medium</span>

#### Keywords
- Breadth-first search
  
#### Idea
This is a typical BFS problem. However, there are two places for optimization. Firstly, the input candidates can be pre-sorted, so that the algorithm can stop early. Secondly, since the BFS exhausts the solution space, and there can be duplicate solutions wherein the number combinations are the same but different in ordering. To avoid this, we can force a specific ordering of the numbers (e.g., ascending order) to avoid duplicates. By forcing the order, we can avoid resorting to hash-based data structures to remove duplicates. 

#### Complexity
- Runtime: O($N^2$)
- Space: O(1)
  
#### LC performance
- Runtime: 48 ms
- Memory usage: 13.6 MB

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def combinationSum(self, candidates: List[int], target: int) -> List[List[int]]:
        from collections import deque

        candidates = sorted(candidates)
        
        res, q = [], deque([([], target)])
        
        while q:
            nums, t = q.popleft()
            if t == 0:
                res += nums,
                continue
            for n in candidates:
                if n > t:
                    break
                if nums and n < nums[-1]:
                    continue
                q += (nums + [n], t - n),
        
        return res
