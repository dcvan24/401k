[Problem description](https://leetcode.com/problems/grumpy-bookstore-owner/)

#### Difficulty

#### Keywords
- Sliding window
  
#### Idea
The problem is equivalent to **finding the maximum with a sliding window with the size of *X***. First of all, the baseline is that the owner can satisfy a `base` number of customers without keeping not grumpy for *X* minutes. The maximum must be greater than the `base` since being not grumpy during the period of being grumpy satisfies more customers. So the idea is to stretch the right bound of the sliding time window during which the owner is always happy, and add the additional satisfied customers to the `base`, until the window size reaches *X*. Then we close the left bound, and subtract the corresponding numbers of customers from the `base` if the window does not start from the current position. Finally, we compare the total number of satisfied customers during the window to the maximum and replace it if it is larger. This process is repeated until the right bound reaches the end.

class Solution:
    def maxSatisfied(self, customers: List[int], grumpy: List[int], X: int) -> int:
        max_num = base = sum([customers[i] if m == 0 else 0 for i, m in enumerate(grumpy)])
        l = r = 0
        while r < len(grumpy):
            if grumpy[r] == 1:
                base += customers[r]
            while r - l + 1 > X:
                if grumpy[l] == 1:
                    base -= customers[l]
                l += 1
            max_num = max(max_num, base)
            r += 1
        return max_num
