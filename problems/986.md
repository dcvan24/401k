#### Idea
A natural follow-up on this problem - **what if there are *k* interval lists where *k* > 2?**. In this case, we can still solve the problem using pointers in O(nk) time - we go over all the *k* lists and check if the current interval has any intersection with the global one. However, we can do better using a heap in O(nlogk) time. The idea is similar to [Merge k Sorted Lists](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-k-sorted-lists) - we use a **min-heap** to keep track of the *k* intervals at the head of the *k* lists, and a variable *end* to keep track of the **maximum end time so far**. Then we start popping from the top of the heap, and check if the start time of the current interval *s* is less than or equal to *end* - if so, that means we find an intersection, and we need to further check if the current start time is even less than the last found intersection's; if so, that means we find an intersection between current interval and the last found intersection, and thus we update the last found intersection with correct start and end time; otherwise, we've found a new intersection disjoint with the previous found ones, whose start time is the start time of the current interval and the end time is the lesser between the current end time and *end*; if the current start time is greater than *end*, there is no intersection with the current *end* and we just move on to the next interval, if any, in the corresponding list. At the end of each iteration, we need to update *end* to ensure it is the maximum end time so far. Once the heap is empty, we have found all the intersections among the *k* lists.

##### Array
```python
class Solution:
    def intervalIntersection(self, A: List[List[int]], B: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
        res = []
        # pointers for traversing A and B
        i = j = 0
        while i < len(A) and j < len(B):
            # start and end time of the current intervals of A and B, 
            # respectively
            (sa, ea), (sb, eb) = A[i], B[j]
            # if A's start time is greater than B's end time, the intervals are 
            # disjoint from each other, we move forward B's pointer in order to 
            # move forward in time
            if sa > eb:
                j += 1
            # similarly, if B's start time is greater than A's end time, we just 
            # move forward A's pointer
            elif sb > ea:
                i += 1
            # otherwise, we find an intersection, whose start time is the 
            # greater between the start time of the intervals, and the end time 
            # is the lesser between the end time. 
            else:
                res.append((max(sa, sb), min(ea, eb)))
                # likewise, since we need to move on in time, we move forward 
                # the pointer of the one lagging in time. 
                if ea < eb:
                    i += 1
                else:
                    j += 1
        
        return res
```

##### Heap
```python
from heapq import heappop, heappush

class Solution:
    def intervalIntersection(self, A: List[List[int]], B: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
        res = []
        if not A or not B:
            return res
        
        # add the first interval of each given list to the heap using the start 
        # time as the key, along the list it belongs to and the cursor to 
        # traverse the list.
        heap = []
        heappush(heap, (A[0], A, 0))
        heappush(heap, (B[0], B, 0))
        
        # a global variable that keeps track of the largest ending time seen so
        # far
        end = -1
        while heap:
            # pop the top of the heap 
            (s, e), arr, i = heappop(heap)
            # if the start time of the current interval is less than or equal to
            # the largest ending time so far, it suggests an intersection is 
            # found. 
            if s <= end:
                # before appending to the result, check if the current interval 
                # intersects with the last found intersection. If it does, 
                # update the last found one if necessary. 
                if res and res[-1][0] <= s <= res[-1][1]:
                    res[-1][:] = [max(res[-1][0], s), min(res[-1][1], e)]
                # otherwise, append to the result
                else:
                    res.append([s, min(end, e)])
            # update the largest ending time 
            end = max(end, e)
            # move forward the cursor
            i += 1
            # if the cursor has yet to reach the end of the list, add the next 
            # interval to the heap
            if i < len(arr):
                heappush(heap, (arr[i], arr, i))
        
        return res
