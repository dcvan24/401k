78 Subsets
=======================
[Problem description](https://leetcode.com/problems/subsets/)

#### Difficulty
<span style="color:#FABC60">Medium</span>

#### Keywords
- Breadth-first search
- Backtracking
  
#### Idea
The key of this problem is to recognize that the given graph is **undirected**, i.e. `[1, 2]` is equivalent to `[2, 1]`. Hence, when performing BFS, we only look forward rather than backward in order to traverse new numbers. 

#### Complexity
- Runtime: O(V)
- Space: O(V)
  
#### LC performance
- Runtime: 40 ms
- Memory usage: 13.4 MB

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def findItinerary(self, tickets: List[List[str]]) -> List[str]:
        # construct the graph
        g = {}
        for s, d in tickets:
            g.setdefault(s, []).append(d)
        for k, v in g.items():
            g[k] = sorted(v, reverse=True)
        
        # select 'JFK' as the starting vertex
        stack, visited, path = ['JFK'], [], []
        
        # run the algorithm until all the vertices are covered
        while g:
            cur = stack.pop()
            path += cur, 
            next_stops = g.get(cur, [])
            if not next_stops and g: # when reaching a sink but there are still vertices uncovered
                # backtrack to the vertex with outbound edge(s)
                while cur not in g:
                    # stash visited vertices
                    visited += path.pop(),
                    cur = path[-1]
                next_stops = g.get(cur, [])
            if next_stops:
                # put the next hop onto the stack for traversal and burn the bridge
                stack += next_stops.pop(),
                if not next_stops:
                    del g[cur]
        # put the last vertex to the end of the path
        if stack:
            path += stack.pop(),
        # put the stashed vertices back to the path
        while visited:
            path += visited.pop(),
        
        return path
