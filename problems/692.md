692 Top K Frequent Words    
=======================
[Problem description](https://leetcode.com/problems/top-k-frequent-words/)

#### Difficulty
<span style="color:#FABC60">Medium</span>

#### Keywords
- Heap
  
#### Idea
The caveat is that words need to be sorted alphebetically if there is a tie in occurrence. The problem asks for the top k words, i.e. words with the top k largest occurrences, while the alphebetical sort starts from the letters with smaller ASCII code. Hence, the goals are contradictory. The workaround is to reverse the occurrence numbers and look for the top k smallest values instead, so that the sorting goals are aligned. 

#### Complexity
- Runtime: O(Nlogk)
- Space: O(N)
  
#### LC performance
- Runtime: 44 ms
- Memory usage: 16.1 MB

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def topKFrequent(self, words: List[str], k: int) -> List[str]:
        import heapq, collections
        freq = {w: (-v, w) for w, v in collections.Counter(words).items()}
        return heapq.nsmallest(k, freq, key=freq.get)
