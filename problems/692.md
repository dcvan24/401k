692 Top K Frequent Words    
=======================
[Problem description](https://leetcode.com/problems/top-k-frequent-words/)

#### Difficulty
<span style="color:#FABC60">Medium</span>

#### Keywords
- [Heap](../categories/heap.md)
  
#### Idea
The caveat is that words need to be sorted alphebetically if there is a tie in occurrence. The problem asks for the top k words, i.e. words with the top k largest occurrences, while the alphebetical sort starts from the letters with smaller ASCII code. Hence, the goals are contradictory. The workaround is to reverse the occurrence numbers and look for the top k smallest values instead, so that the lexicographical order is aligned. 

#### Complexity
- Runtime: O(Nlogk)
- Space: O(N)
  
#### LC performance
- Runtime: 44 ms
- Memory usage: 16.1 MB

#### Code
```python
from heapq import heappush, heappop
from collections import Counter

class Solution:
    def topKFrequent(self, words: List[str], k: int) -> List[str]:
        # use a max heap to hold the least frequent words in complementary to 
        # the top K frequent ones
        heap, res = [], []
        # count the distinct words
        counter = Counter(words)
        for w, count in counter.items():
            # put the word into the heap with both its count as the primary key 
            # and the word itself as the secondary key
            heappush(heap, (-count, w))
            # Given `N` distinct words, when the heap size is greater than 
            # `N - k`, pop off the word on the top, which is one of the top K 
            # frequent words, from the heap and put it into the result
            if len(heap) > len(counter) - k:
                res.append(heappop(heap))
        # sort the top K words by their occurrences first and then 
        # lexicographically
        return [w for _, w in sorted(res)]
