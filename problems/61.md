61 Rotate List
=======================
[Problem description](https://leetcode.com/problems/rotate-list/)

#### Difficulty
<span style="color:#FABC60">Medium</span>

#### Keywords
- Linked list
  
#### Idea
The subtlety of this problem lies in that ***k* can be larger than the length of the given linked list**. As shown in the given example, the rotation needs to be performed in a **cyclic** manner in this case, i.e., the rotation needs to be repeated if *k* is a multiple of the length of the given list. The key observation is that **rotating the whole list results the original list, i.e., no rotation is seemingly performed when `k == <length of the given list>`**. Hence, we can take a mod of *k* over the length of the list to cut the repeated rotations of the whole list, i.e., `k = k%<length of the given list>`.

In implementation, there could also be awkwardness in handling pointers. The trick used here is to **connect the head and tail of the given list to make it a cyclic list**, so that all we need to do is to find the right position to "cut" the list and make it acyclic again. 

#### Complexity

- Space: O(1)
  
#### LC performance

#### Code
```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.next = None

class Solution:
    def rotateRight(self, head: ListNode, k: int) -> ListNode:
        if not head:
            return head
        p, size = head, 1
        while p.next:
            p = p.next 
            size += 1
        p.next = head
        
        k = k%size
        p = head
        for _ in range(size - k - 1):
            p = p.next
        head, p.next = p.next, None
        return head
```
