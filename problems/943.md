        """
        Intuitively, the shortest super string exploits the common grounds 
        shared among the given words, therefore minimizing the repetition of the 
        shared substrings. Viewing each word as a vertex in a graph, we can 
        construct a weighted directed graph in which each edge is the common 
        substring shared between a pair of words - the shared substring is the 
        suffix and prefix of the source and destination of the edge, 
        respectively, and its length is the weight. Words do not share anything 
        has an edge between each other with zero weight, so the graph is fully 
        connected. Our goal is to find the shortest hamilton path in the graph. 

        To find the shortest path, we can use Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm 
        - we start from an empty string and keep concatenating it with the given 
        words until all the words are concatenated; the concatenation merges 
        any common substring shared between two given strings in order to reduce 
        the string length; the algorithm opts for the shortest concatenation at 
        each step, and as a result, the first concatenation that includes all 
        the given words is guaranteed shortest. 

        In implementation, since the edge weights are not given directly but
        calculated by comparing the given words pairwise, which takes O(n^2) 
        time. Repeating the calculation is obviously unwise, but memoizing the 
        weights can avoid the repetitive calculations and thus save time.
