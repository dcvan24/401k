#### Idea
The key is to **narrow down the number selections based on given *n* and *k***. The number of permutations is a factorial of *n*, i.e., `f(n) = n!`. For example, given `n == 4`, there are `4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 24` permutations, and say we pick `1` as the first digit, then there are `3 * 2 * 1 = 6` permutations starting with 1, and so on.Â Herein, given `k`, we can select the digits iteratively and narrow down the number selections progressively. 

As illustrated, given `n == 4`, there are 4 numbers for selection for the first digit and a total of 24 permutations, every 6 sharing the same starting number. Since the permutations are ordered in sequence, if given `k == 9`, the permutation we are looking for is defintely not starting with `1` since the last permutation starting with `1` is the 6th in the sequence. Specifically, the target permutation is the 3rd permutation starting with `2`. Now we pick `2` as the first digit, and we need to find the 3rd permutation for the rest of digits, i.e. `k == 3`. Now there are 3 numbers for selection, consisting a total of 6 permutations and every 2 sharing the same starting number. As we have done before, the second digit will be `3` since `k == 3` is beyond the "partition" of `1`. In more detail, the target permutation is the first permutation starting with `23`... Keep doing this and we will find the target permutation.

class Solution:
    def getPermutation(self, n: int, k: int) -> str:
        cands = [str(i + 1) for i in range(n)]
        res = []
        
        f = 1
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            f *= i
            
        for i in range(n):
            f //= (n - i)
            j, k = k//f, k%f
            if k == 0:
                j -= 1
            res += cands.pop(j),
            
        return ''.join(res)
