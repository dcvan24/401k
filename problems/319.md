        The key to the problem is to realize that a bulb can only be lighted on 
        if and only if it is toggled for an odd number of times. With the bulb 
        switching pattern described in the problem, the `i`-th bulb will be 
        toggled in round `r` if `r` divides `i` evenly. For example, given 12 
        bulbs, at round 6, the 6th and 12th bulbs will be toggled since every 
        6 bulb in the sequence will be toggled. 

        Obviously, divisors come in pairs and are all smaller than the number 
        being divided for integers, e.g., 12 has 3 and 4 as divisors, which 
        means, the 12th bulb will remain the same state after the 3rd and 4th 
        round, since it gets switched on and off at round 3 and 4, respectively. 
        The only exception is that the sequence number of the bulb is a square, 
        in which case it has a duplicate pair of divisors, e.g., 4 has 2s as its 
        divisors, but there is only one 2nd round so the 4th bulb won't be 
        toggled in the other round that cancels out the effect of the 2nd round. 
        In other word, only square numbers can be on after n-th round, so our 
        job is to find the number of square numbers smaller than or equal to 
        `n`.

        As said before, the divisors are always smaller than the number being 
        divided for integers, and so is square root. `sqrt(n)` is the 
        largest square root for the number less than or equal to `n` and the 
        smallest one is 1. So integers between 1 and `sqrt(n)` are the square 
        roots for all the numbers smaller than or equal to `n`, therefore `n` is 
        the number of squares less than or equal to `n`, i.e. the numbers of 
        bulbs left on after n-th round. 
        """
        return int(sqrt(n))
