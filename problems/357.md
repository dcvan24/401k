#### Keywords

#### Idea
The core idea is to **consider how many numbers left to select for every digit if we assemble a number progressively from 1 to n digits**. Obviously, given `n == 0`, the only non-negative number less than $10^n$ is `0`, therefore the function returns 1. Similarly, given `n == 10`, we are free to select any number from `0` to `9` for the single-digit number, and as a result, there are 10 numbers available. Starting from `n == 2`, we need to think of how many numbers are free for choice at each digit. For instance, for the first digit, we have 9 numbers excluding 0 to select since an n-digit number cannot start with `0`. For the second digit, we have 9 numbers left including 0, since we have already select one for the first digit. For third digit, we have 8 left, and so on. Therefore, for an n-digit number, there are 9 * 9 * 8 * ... * (9 - n + 2) numbers without duplicates. Finally, the count accrues across numbers with 1 to n digits, so we need to add them up as the result.

```python
class Solution:
    def countNumbersWithUniqueDigits(self, n: int) -> int:
        if n == 0:
            return 1
        if n == 1:
            return 10
        cnt = 10
        for i in range(2, n + 1):
            base = 9
            for j in range(i - 1):
                base *= 9 - j
            cnt += base
        return cnt
