229 Majority Element II
=======================
[Problem description](https://leetcode.com/problems/majority-element-ii/)

#### Difficulty
<span style="color:#FABC60">Medium</span>

#### Keywords
- [Moore's voting algorithm](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/majority-element/)
  
#### Idea
The premise of using **Moore's voting algorithm** is that **there must exist majority number(s)**. The idea is to cancel out the occurrences of majority and minority numbers, and the majority one(s) will survive till the end. 

This problem in essence asks us to find two majority numbers if any, since it is impossible to have three majority numbers with occurrences > *n/3*, where *n* is the size of given array. An additional step is also required to check if the occurrences of the found majority numbers satisfy the *n/3* occurrence requirement. 

#### Complexity
- Runtime: O(N)
- Space: O(1)
  
#### LC performance
- Runtime: 52 ms
- Memory usage: 13.8 MB

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def majorityElement(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        m1, m2, c1, c2 = None, None, 0, 0
        for n in nums:
            if n == m1:
                c1 += 1
            elif n == m2:
                c2 += 1
            elif m1 is None:
                m1, c1 = n, 1
            elif m2 is None:
                m2, c2 = n, 1
            else:
                c1 -= 1
                c2 -= 1
                if c1 == 0:
                    m1 = None
                if c2 == 0:
                    m2 = None
        c1, c2 = 0, 0
        for n in nums:
            if n == m1:
                c1 += 1
            if n == m2:
                c2 += 1
        res = []
        if c1 > len(nums)/3:
            res += m1,
        if c2 > len(nums)/3:
            res += m2,
        return res if len(res) < 2 or res[0] != res[1] else [res[0]]
