399 Evaluate Division
=======================
[Problem description](https://leetcode.com/problems/evaluate-division/)

#### Difficulty
<span style="color:#FABC60">Medium</span>

#### Keywords
- Breadth-first search
- Backtracking
  
#### Idea
The idea is to use breadth-first search to exhaust the solution space of the given equations and find the solution to every given query. The trick is to **keep track of the reciprocal of every given equation** to make the graph **fully connected**. The consequence is that, by introducing the reciprocals, there will be cycles, so the algorithm needs to **detect the cycles and stop early using backtracking** during the graph traversal.  

#### Complexity
- Runtime: O(MN)
- Space: O(N)
  
#### LC performance
- Runtime: 36 ms
- Memory usage: 13.1 MB

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def calcEquation(self, equations: List[List[str]], values: List[float], queries: List[List[str]]) -> List[float]:
        from collections import deque
        
        relations = {}
        for i, (n, d) in enumerate(equations):
            relations.setdefault(n, {})[d] = values[i]
            relations.setdefault(d, {})[n] = 1/values[i]
            
        res = []
        for n, d in queries:
            q = deque([(n, 1., set())])
            found = False
            while q:
                var, v, trace = q.popleft()
                if var == d and var in relations:
                    res += v,
                    found = True
                    break
                for nn, vv in relations.get(var, {}).items():
                    if nn in trace:
                        continue
                    trace.add(nn)
                    q += (nn, v * vv, set(trace)),
                    trace.remove(nn)
            if not found:
                res += -1.,
        
        return res
